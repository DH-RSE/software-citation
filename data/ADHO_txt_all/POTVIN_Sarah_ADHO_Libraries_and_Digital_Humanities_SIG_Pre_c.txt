Libraries and other cultural heritage organisations (CHOs) and their staff have a central role in digital humanities, as collection builders, project and service managers, and experts on how to use their collections to the fullest by digital means. Given the importance many of these organisations attach to their role as supporters of research, a case can be made for the opportunity and need for libraries and their staff to position and assert themselves as partners in research.
We will address the issues raised when talking about libraries as digital humanities research partners. This pre-conference will present opportunities and examples to showcase library-based digital humanities work that makes the case for the partner model. This will be approached from different angles; discussing why this model is mutually beneficial to both library and partner organisations, what policies and infrastructure are needed for the organisation to be able to become a sustainable partner, which steps are needed for staff to obtain relevant skills, and finally how to choose who to partner with and then build those relationships.
Two keynote speakers will set the theme of the event. The rest of the programme will be filled through a call for participation for short papers, lightning talks, panels, and workshops.
This full-day pre-conference will be held at the National Library of the Netherlands in the Hague. Transportation will be provided from Utrecht.
