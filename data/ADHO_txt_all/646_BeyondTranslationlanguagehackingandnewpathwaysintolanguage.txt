Our work focuses on how audiences can push beyond translation, immediately engaging with the source text in the original language and internalizing as much knowledge of a language as their interest and available time warrant. The work-in-progress that we describe involves collaborators in Europe and North America, with funding from the US-based Mellon Foundation, the German DAAD, and the US National Endowment for the Humanities. Our work pragmatically exploits the rich body of openly licensed data available in Ancient Greek and the transnational position of Ancient Greek (along with languages such as Classical Chinese, Sanskrit, Classical Arabic, and Pre-modern Persian) but our work also engages with sources in languages such as Classical Arabic, Pre-modern Hebrew, Pre-modern Persian, and Early English and, in presenting at DH 2020, we hope to make contact with a wider range of languages.
