The ADHO Special Interest Group for Digital Humanities Pedagogy and Training offers a special mini-conference that builds upon the DH2019 conference theme, “Complexities,” we are eager to foster a discussion about the many ways in which DH is taught and learned in academic contexts across languages, borders, cultures, and academic structures. This half-day conference will consist of presentation and breakout sessions. The presentation format will focus on lightning talks of 5-8 minutes in length. Proposals are welcome on any topic informing or treating Digital Humanities Pedagogy and Training, including (but not limited to) those focusing on DH training in an international context, i.e. how we articulate/coordinate/collaborate across international boundaries, and what we can learn from our differences and what do we share; how does teaching DH in a global context reveal the complexities of intercultural communication and pedagogy; developing a multilingual lexicon for teaching DH.
During the mini-conference we will also break into groups to identify opportunities and possibilities for the SIG to engage in during the coming year.
A Call for Proposals will be issued separately.
Conveners of the Digital Humanities Pedagogy and Training Special Interest Group: Ray Siemens (University of Victoria), Diane Jakacki (Bucknell University), Katie Faull (Bucknell University), Brian Croxall (Brigham Young University), Walter Scholger (University of Graz)
