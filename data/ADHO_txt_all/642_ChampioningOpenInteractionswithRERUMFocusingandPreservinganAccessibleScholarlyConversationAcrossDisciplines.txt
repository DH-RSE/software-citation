Rerum is a completely discrete set of services for creating and manipulating not only Web Annotations, but also IIIF documents and related objects. Our current services allow for generic interoperability and discoverability through the "unseen" services, coaxing the interface designer to intentionally shape the screen around the purpose of the user experience. In this way, the data model cannot be proprietary, removing the need for data import and exportâ€”interoperability has been replaced with simple operability.
