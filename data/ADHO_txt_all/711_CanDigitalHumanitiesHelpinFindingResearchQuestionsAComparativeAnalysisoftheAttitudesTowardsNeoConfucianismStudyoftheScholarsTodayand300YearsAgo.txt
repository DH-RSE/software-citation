In this paper, we compare the results of our two studies: one takes Song Yuan Xue An, a book finished 300 years ago about the Neo-Confucianism history in Song and Yuan Dynasties, as the data source; while the other takes 5384 Neo-Confucianism-themed journal articles published over the past 30 years as the data source. In the first study, the overall development of Neo-Confucianism is divided into four phases through network analysis. But the numbers of contemporary research papers distributed over these four phases are significant unequal, thus indicating that the second phase, i.e. the period dominated by ancient scholars Yang Shi and Hu Anguo and their disciples, is neglected by contemporary scholars. These blind areas could lead to further humanities research questions.
