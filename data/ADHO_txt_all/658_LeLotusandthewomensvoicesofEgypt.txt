Between 1892 and 1919, over 30 journals and periodicals written by women for women were publish in Egypt. These publications paved the way to the Middle East’s most successful feminist movement which took place in Egypt after the revolution of 1919. The period during which these journals and periodicals were published and the feminist movement they fueled is known as the Women’s Awakening. For my poster presentation, I want to highlight the relation between the women’s press of Egypt and the political and literary landscapes prior to the 1919 revolution by analyzing the texts of the Lotus.
