Network analysis methods are not a novelty in literary studies and in drama’s research in particular. However, one approach is not enough to cover all the nuances of characters’ relations. In this study, I combined network analysis methods and quantitative measures. This work is the first look at ‘quantitative dominance relations’ in Russian drama. Also, I present the method to divide characters of each play into groups of importance. It is used to assess the development of the structure of dramatis personae over time.
