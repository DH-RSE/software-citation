This paper presents a digital and computational approach to studying the historical of international anti-colonialism in the long 1960s. In particular, I utilize these methods to both craft new datasets and new understandings of how this global movement was shaped by local concerns and linguistic divisions. From Afro-Asianism to the Black Press, I argue that computing anti-colonial discourses can provide new insights into how ideas and information circulated in the emerging Third World.
