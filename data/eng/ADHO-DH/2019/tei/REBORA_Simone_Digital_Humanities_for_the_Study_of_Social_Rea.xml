                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Over the last decades, with technological advancements
                    such as growing digitalization and the development of social media platforms,
                    the act of reading has transformed into an interactive experience (Cordón-García
                    et al., 2013; Merga, 2015), where the Internet plays a key role (Murray, 2018).
                    Social reading platforms like Goodreads and Wattpad are online environments
                    where millions of people from all over the world come to share their love for
                    the written word. Members come together to discuss what they have read and what
                    they judge as good or bad literature, they recommend books to one another, and
                    even try their hand at writing fiction.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">While a growing number of studies have been dedicated
                    to this phenomenon (Nakamura, 2013; Ramdarshan Bold, 2016), so far only a few
                    have adopted computational methods (Faggiolani and Vivarelli, 2016; Thelwall and
                    Kousha, 2017) and none has combined these methods with empirical approaches to
                    the study of literature and its effects.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">As the online environment is very different from the
                    literary field as we know it, showing new types of complex interactions, we need
                    to explore social reading and writing from both social and content perspectives.
                    Social questions that should be investigated include interaction among users,
                    questions of power (sources of literary authority), the effects on literacy and
                    on reading behaviors, the changing system of social values (and of aesthetic
                    evaluation). Content questions include questions about style, about the
                    distribution and originality of comments, about the affective, reflective or
                    social nature of content.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">With this panel, we will showcase the potential of
                    studying social reading through the combination of multiple and interrelated
                    approaches: from purely statistical, data-driven, and stylometric analyses,
                    through qualitative and quantitative surveys of key users and a theory-driven
                    qualitative taxonomy of reading valuation, towards a combination of the
                    empirical and the computational, supported by a sound theoretical/methodological
                    awareness. The substantial variety of case studies in four languages (English,
                    German, Italian, and Dutch) will reflect the diversity of social reading, which
                    can and should be studied from multiple points of view as well as with an array
                    of methodological tools.</p>

                    </ref>, where social reading takes the form of a “discussion in the margin”
                    (Stein, 2010), i.e. where texts are commented upon by millions of users,
                    paragraph by paragraph. A central goal of our study is to understand how the
                    corpus of the most appreciated texts on <hi rend="italic">Wattpad</hi> is
                    different from the canonical corpus of Western literature. For a preliminary
                    analysis, we focused on the categories of “Classics” and “Teen Fiction” (TF). </p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Analysis I.</hi> For a first understanding of readers’
                    engagement, we examined the progression of the number of comments over the 20
                    most-commented books for each genre. Figures 1 and 2 show that TF is more
                    stable, whereas for many Classics the majority of comments is on the first
                    chapters. Also the total numbers are very different: 2,569,405 comments for the
                    first TF title and just 42,013 for <hi rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</hi>. </p>

                    response, we adopted sentiment analysis and compared the “emotional arcs”
                    (Reagan et al., 2016) of both paragraphs and comments. The analysis was

                    are described in (Rebora and Pianzola, 2018). Figures 3 and 4 show a better
                    attunement between paragraphs and comments in TF: the highest Pearson&apos;s
                    correlation (0.807; p-value &lt; 2.2e-16) was reached by TF title #3. </p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Analysis III</hi>. To explore the relations between users
                    while reading the books, we adopted network analysis (Scott, 2017) based on a
                    very simple rule: the more two users reply to each other’s comments, the
                    stronger is their connection. The visualizations were realized through the <ref
                        target="https://gephi.org/">
                        <hi rend="italic underline color(000080)"><rs type="software"
                            >Gephi</rs></hi>
                    </ref> platform. Figures 5 and 6 show the networks of the most commented
                    Classics and TF titles. To make the samples comparable, the networks were
                    reduced to the 1,000 strongest connections. As evident, Classics readers tend to
                    group in a single cluster, while TF readers group in multiple sub-clusters. This
                    phenomenon seems to suggest that reading classics enhances the formation of a
                    more homogeneous community. </p>

                <head>Sources of authority in online book reviews</head>
                <p rend="DH-Heading3" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; ">Peter Boot</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">It is a commonplace to state that with the advent of
                    Amazon, book blogs and readers’ communities the role of traditional authorities
                    in the literary field has become less important (McDonald, 2007). Rather than
                    following the lead of professional critics, teachers or professors, readers are
                    said to take advice from fellow readers. In my contribution to this panel, I
                    will look at the evidence that a corpus of online Dutch book reviews can provide
                    for answering the question which persons or institutions are considered
                    authoritative by online reviewers.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; "> In a pilot investigation, we have looked at references
                    to possible authorities from a number of domains: traditional critics,
                    newspapers, prizes, television programs, the book trade (publishers,
                    booksellers, libraries), authors, teachers, websites and private contacts.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Reviews were downloaded from some prominent weblogs,
                    some dedicated (mass) review sites, the online magazine 8weekly and, for
                    contrast, the most prominent Dutch newspaper NRC (Boot, 2013). We used
                    collections of search terms and regular expressions to search the downloaded
                    reviews using AntConc. Irrelevant hits were removed manually. A subset of the
                    remaining results was annotated and assigned a <hi rend="italic">type</hi> (type
                    of person or institution that is assigned authority), <hi rend="italic"
                        >role</hi> (role of reference to authority in review, e.g. the authority is
                    mentioned as supporting the reviewer’s view or as the one who advised the
                    reviewer to read the book) and <hi rend="italic">agreement</hi> (whether the
                    reviewer accepts the view of the authority). In all 1518 references to some form
                    of authority were annotated. Because of many practical limitations and ad-hoc
                    decisions, the procedure won’t give us any firm numbers but it does give a clear
                    indication of sources of authority that are recognised in the online domain. </p>

                    reviews</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">The main findings are summarized in Figure 1. The main
                    sources of authority in the online reviews are companies (publishers and
                    bookshops) and literary prizes. Authors (of the reviewed book or others) are
                    also important. Online critics (‘peers’) are not unimportant, but print critics
                    are hardly mentioned. Personal contacts (family and friends) are more important
                    than print critics. Frequently, people refer to a medium rather than to a critic
                    by name, but here too, online media are more often mentioned than print media.
                    Teachers are almost invisible.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; "> Much can be said about this. For one thing, we counted
                    all references equal but some will weigh heavier than others. There are also
                    important differences between the online platforms. The collection we used did
                    not include reviews from booksellers’ sites. For now, though, the most important
                    conclusion is that no, traditional critics are not highly valued on online
                    platforms; however, the beneficiaries are commercial companies rather than
                    fellow users of online platforms.</p>

                    what features can be used to identify them?</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">The corpus is divided into three subsets: reviews
                    published on social reading platforms (source: <ref

                <p style="text-align:left; ">First, we adopted stylometry to classify the texts. As
                    demonstrated by (Eder, 2015), the first element to influence the quality of a
                    stylometric classification is text length. Preliminary tests—ran with the <ref

                            type="software">Stylo</rs></ref> R package (Eder et al., 2016) on
                    5,000-word-long text chunks—showed how Cosine Delta distance, based on just 50
                    MFW, was able to almost perfectly separate the three subgroups (see Fig. 1).
                    Considered the high variance of text length in our corpus (mean = 259 words; SD
                    = 363 words), we artificially generated a series of sub-corpora composed by text
                    chunks of the same length (varying between 50 and 5,000 words) and we evaluated
                    clustering quality through the adjusted Rand index in the <ref

                    distance with 2,000 MFW is the best performing classifier (Evert et al., 2017),
                    but also 200 MFW (i.e., mainly function words) reach a similar—and, in some
                    cases, even better—efficiency. As for text length, clustering quality is quite
                    poor below 1,000 words, while a plateau is reached at about 3,000 words. </p>

                    a framework for a machine learning classifier, by operationalizing a series of
                    traditional definitions of literary criticism (e.g. Eco, 1979; Gardt, 1998;
                    Rodler, 2004; Colussi, 2017). An extensive lexicon of literary criticism (Beck
                    et al., 2007) was translated into Italian; selections of terms related to mental
                    imagery and emotional aesthetic response were extracted from questionnaires and
                    tools in empirical aesthetics (e.g. Knoop et al., 2016; Fialho et al., in
                    press), translated into Italian, and expanded through the <ref

                        >fastText Italian</ref> word-embedding model (Joulin et al., 2017). These

                    Italian dictionary—were used to measure emotional and cognitive involvement with
                    the reviewed text. The measurements were combined with the results of the
                    stylometric analysis (Cosine Delta, 2,000 MFW) and used to train an SVM
                    classifier. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">For a corpus composed by 500-word-long chunks (the
                    length of this abstract), the sole stylometric analysis reached an attribution
                    accuracy of 90.1%, while the SVM classifier scored 93.2%. A slight but promising
                    improvement, if we consider the simplicity of the framework—that can and should
                    be refined further.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left; ">In the digital age, the practice and habits of reading
                    change fundamentally. Not few speak of the end of the book and of (deep) reading
                    (e.g., Wolf 2007). However, and contrary to this popular statement, reading and
                    writing literature has never been practiced as intensely as within digital
                    societies (Lauer 2018, 2019) – a development that involves in particular young,
                    adolescent readers.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">In preliminary studies, we categorized various reading
                    and writing platforms and conducted a first study on Harry Potter-fanfiction,
                    using a personality questionnaire (Paulus 2016). Results indicate a dominance of
                    romance as well as of fantasy genres (see also Odag 2008) and that authors of
                    fanfiction are usually between 14 and 20 years old. They show both introverted
                    and extroverted personality traits and come from diverse educational
                    backgrounds. Generally, they can be considered rather empathetic. In a similar
                    vein, other reading research suggests that dealing with literary texts increases
                    performance in Theory of Mind, and thus might the support the development of
                    prosocial skills such as empathy (Kidd &amp; Castano 2013).</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Despite justified criticism on over-generalizations
                    (e.g., van Kuijk et al. 2018), research on the emerging changes towards digital,
                    joint reading of texts with presumably much lower literary demands and its
                    potential implications is missing. This is the more surprising, since first
                    explorative studies in schools indicate that digital formats can be used very
                    well for education through writing and reading (Bertschi-Kaufmann &amp; Graber
                    2007, Wampfler 2016) and not only shed light on, but also foster a variety of
                    effects. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how and with what consequences
                    digitization affects the reading behavior of adolescents, including complex
                    processes such as (higher) language acquisition, establishments of social
                    peer-groups and their interactions, as well as their understanding and
                    appreciation of literature and the written word.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Our project focuses on the changing social processes
                    that accompany the reading and writing of literature in the digital age. In
                    doing so, we focus on the young readers and their distinct reading and writing
                    socialization on digital reading (and writing) platforms such as Wattpad. Based
                    on a social interactionist-reading model and the theoretical concept of
                    “scaffolding” (see, for example, Bruner 1983, Nation 2018, Quasthoff 2011) the
                    project integrates descriptive, qualitative and quantitative methods in a
                    multi-methodological approach.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">We present a questionnaire that combines established
                    scales from social psychology with items used in reading research to explore
                    online and offline reading habits. Using new methods of field research enables a
                    better understanding of how intensively young readers think and feel about
                    reading and writing literature and what kind of values are used to talk about
                    literature in social media. To arrive at a more comprehensive picture of reading
                    in the digital age, we provide a general theoretical framework that helps to
                    integrate the thus acquired data.</p>

                    values</head>

                <p style="text-align:left; ">Traditionally, reading fiction has been seen as a tool
                    for honing crucial sense-making capacities, enabling an integrated sensual and
                    intellectual personal development ( <hi rend="italic">judicium sensitivum</hi>,
                    Wolff, 1738; cf. Lauer, 2012). Web 2.0 users, on the other hand, are understood
                    not so much as interested in the challenges and pleasures of literature-as-art,
                    but in the easy gratification of popular genres, driven by an economy of
                    attention (Franck, 2004). Users’ book reviews are held to show an affirmative
                    bias, documenting the lack of a deep and discerning reading engagement (Ingold,
                    2014). Mirroring a stated trend towards a “digestible” documentary and authentic
                    literature (Röhricht, 2016), lay reviewers are held to operate with a heavy
                    content bias and to neglect formal criteria. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">However, many of these verdicts lack comprehensive
                    empirical support, leaving questions such as the following ones open: What do
                    web 2.0 readers actually do when judging literary value? What are the grounds
                    for value judgements? Do readers apply aesthetic and ethical premises? Do they
                    prioritize content over formal criteria? In our paper, we will scrutinize a
                    corpus of lay literature reviews published on the German reading platform
                    lovelybooks.de for the premises underlying users’ valuation statements.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Using sentiment analysis and rule-based techniques as a
                    bootstrap methodology for semi-automatic identification of valuation statements
                    in our corpus (ca. 1 Mio reviews), our exploratory case study analyzes the
                    lovelybooks.de categories ‘classics’ and ‘novels’ Combining quantitative and
                    qualitative methods, we examine how users evaluate literary texts in terms of
                    quality criteria such as subjectively perceived effects, but also more formal
                    ones, including authorial style, literary character motivation and plot
                    construction (motivation, narrative arc, suspense).</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">In addition to semi-automatic coding and running KWICs
                    of recurrent phrases and keywords, we analyze a number of reviews as integral
                    cases. How do users develop their (subjective) assessments? How do assessments
                    appear in terms of tone and habitus? How do users prioritize the different
                    categories for their evaluation? The qualitative coding is aimed at fine-tuning
                    a coding schema that adapts the axiological model by Heydebrand &amp; Winko
                    (1996) for web 2.0 lay reviews.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Our first results do indeed point to users’ heightened
                    subjectivity and a tendency to plain statements, reporting subjectively
                    perceived effects ( <hi rend="italic">a bit too melancholic, I found it a
                        pity</hi>) and marking taste ( <hi rend="italic">I liked it well</hi>). Yet,
                    we found considerable attention to formal aspects such as plot construction (
                        <hi rend="italic">some of the events were not plausible to me</hi>) and
                    character motivation ( <hi rend="italic">the characters were well crafted</hi>),
                    as well as critical (not only affirmative) judgements. What is more, our results
                    indicate that many users do apply a plain and subjectively toned language, but
                    handle a reflected taxonomy of value criteria to support their taste judgements,
                    expressed by statements such as
                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Noch schwerer wog bei der Sternevergabe … </hi>[The
                    awarding of stars was even more influenced by…], <hi rend="italic">Ein Punkt,
                        der mir sehr wichtig ist</hi> [A point that is very important to me]. We
                    thus suggest that instead of propelling a decline of intellectual scrutiny and
                    differentiation, online reading platforms offer a potential for personal insight
                    and development. Our study is one of the first few data-driven approaches to
                    scrutinize the literary values underlying people’s engagement with literary
                    texts in a participatory culture. </p>

                <p style="text-align:left; ">Our research aims to complement computational
                    linguistics with methods used in empirical literary studies to investigate the
                    experience of “getting lost in a book”. Using software from the field of natural
                    language processing, we match the 18 statements from the Story World Absorption
                    Scale (SWAS, cf. Kuijpers et al., 2014) – a questionnaire used to identify
                    absorbing reading experiences – to reader reviews posted on the online platform <ref target="HYPERLINK" xml:space="preserve"> </ref>
                    <ref target="https://www.goodreads.com/about/us">
                        <hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Goodreads</hi>
                    </ref>. The SWAS taps into four different aspects of absorbed reading, namely
                    sustained concentration (Attention), vivid imagery of the story world (Mental
                    Imagery), feelings of empathy or sympathy for the characters of a story
                    (Emotional Engagement) and the sensation of having made a deictic shift from
                    real world to story world (Transportation). The reader reviews on Goodreads more
                    often than not include descriptions of people’s experiences with certain books
                    and evaluations of their reading experiences, and therefore it could be argued
                    that they fall somewhere between accounts of reader response and literary
                    criticism. They certainly constitute a rare treasure trove of qualitative,
                    user-generated data on reading and reading evaluation. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">The aims of our project are twofold: 1) validating the
                    SWAS, and 2) enabling comparative analyses of absorption across different books,
                    genres, and reader groups.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">We have performed a manual analysis on 180 Goodreads
                    reviews of three contemporary blockbuster novels (representative of the Fantasy,
                    the Romance, and the Thriller genre), confirming that, in many cases, SWAS
                    statements and particular sentences in Goodreads reviews overlap substantially. <ref target="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/199709935" xml:space="preserve"> For example, </ref>

                <p style="text-align:left; ">In order to extend the analysis to the entire Goodreads
                    corpus, which collects about 80 million book reviews, we combine two
                    technologies: textual entailment detection software, i.e., EOP (Magnini et al.,
                    2014) and text reuse detection software, i.e., TRACER (Büchler et al., 2018).
                    Preliminary experiments (Rebora et al., 2018) show that both tools need
                    adaptation and training for this specific task, as our best “out of the box”
                    recall score is 0.28, while training on the manually-annotated reviews increases
                    recall to 0.49.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Based on the 130 identified sentences plus the 18 SWAS
                    statements, we defined a provisional “absorption lexicon” and expanded it
                    through a word-embedding model (Mikolov et al., 2013) based on 2.5 million
                    reviews on Goodreads (total tokens ~ 400 million). Figure 2 shows a synthetic
                    representation of this lexicon.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left; ">The lexicon was used to identify, through a standard
                    “bag-of-words” approach, the reviews that showed the highest levels of
                    absorption. The results, while significant in themselves (see Figs. 3 and 4 for
                    sample visualizations), are used as the starting point for extensive
                    semi-automatic annotation work – with four annotators working in parallel for a
                    total of 18 months, starting in December 2018. Our goal will be that of
                    producing a ground truth corpus as training data for machine learning
                    algorithms, towards a fully-automated matching of Goodreads reviews with the
                    different aspects of absorbed reading.</p>
