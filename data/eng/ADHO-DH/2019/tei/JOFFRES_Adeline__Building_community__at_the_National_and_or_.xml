            <p style="text-align:left; ">Knowledge production has always act globally, and when it
                comes to the humanities early networks of scholars can still be traced in their
                letter correspondence. With the emergence of digital humanities more prominently in
                the 1970s, research communities have organized themselves in many different ways.
                The enthusiasm generated by the promises of what was sometimes perceived as a
                &quot;new field&quot; were to some extent echoed in new forms of
                institutionalization, to the point of defining a discipline in its own right. But
                the enthusiasms was also accompanied by a certain resistance of communities
                reluctant to introduce digital technology into their field.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">The term of &quot;digital humanities&quot; in these earlier
                days of adopting digital methods into the humanities created an area, a niche,
                inside which pioneers in Digital Humanities could gain critical mass. Today, where
                digital methods are far more widely applied, one can observe an almost opposite
                trend, the abandoning of a ‘specific label’ and a much broader advocacy concerning
                all humanities. </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">What remains specific for DH communities is the close
                alliance between content providers (which themselves are in a process of
                digitisation content and access), humanities scholars applying digital methods, and
                computer scientists linking to new methodological achievements in their field.
                However, this alliance can express itself in very different forms of national and
                international organisation, and is far from following a specific model.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">This panel examines different ways of &quot;forming a
                community&quot; among digital humanities scholars and scholars in other fields, and
                other actors in DH. The contributions span a range from generic ways to design
                digital research infrastructures in the SSH, over national solutions to
                supranational coordination</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">The purpose of this panel is to unfold the diversity of the
                current &quot;digital humanist movement”, not only to compare, but also to
                understand what is at stake for the actors involved and what impact the different
                forms of organisation have on creation and evolution of research communities. We
                further discuss issues of cohesion and durability. Through the papers presented, we
                will examine the impact of bottom-up, top-down and horizontal strategies as well as
                the adoption of hybrid solutions (organizational, disciplinary, methodological,
                scalar) in the design of research communities. This approach will allow us to put
                convergences and challenges into perspective and to question the re-compositions at
                work within SSH communities. </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">This panel will highlight the experiences of SSH research
                communities from different cultures and organizations rooted at different levels of
                governance, such as some French communities structured around institutional nodes
                such as Maisons des Sciences de l&apos;Homme (MSH), or research infrastructures at
                the national (TGIR Huma-Num) or European level (DARIAH ERIC); project based
                collaboration of research infrastructures (DANS, The Netherlands) and Canada
                (CRIHN); and professional networks and transnational associations related to digital
                humanities (e.g. Humanistica, the French-speaking association of digital humanities,
                or the Latin American network for digital humanities under construction). The
                comparison of the experiences presented will not produce a homogeneous and smooth
                image but will highlight differences in approaches and organisation. Even it seems
                nearly impossible to give account of every association that could be representative
                on a way to build community in DH, the chair of the session will make an
                introduction with a brief summary of this landscape. That said, besides the
                geographical aspect that we try to include, another is that we are giving voice to
                formal and informal associations such as the LatamHD network, that is just at an
                early stage and that is not yet defined in its goals. We decided to propose several
                solutions to deal with the diversity of needs and practises inside our communities
                and we wanted to present some of them to share our experiences and initiate
                discussions during this panel in order to develop collaborations with colleagues
                sharing the same kind of constraints.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; "> </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">Thus, the objective is to have a broad discussion with the
                audience to broaden the perspectives to other experiences.</p>

                    <hi rend="background(white)">The Digital Humanities is a broad church of
                        different communities, each with differing methodologies, approaches to data
                        creation, and data processing; developed organically over time. For
                        cross-community communication and interaction there must be a common form in
                        which to describe the communities and their components. Understanding
                        commonalities and differences is key to the successful building of
                        infrastructures, and especially for distributed transnational
                        supra-community research infrastructures. The creation of international
                        e-infrastructures such as the European Research Infrastructure Consortium
                        (ERICs) such as DARIAH-EU and CESSDA (and others on the ESFRI roadmap) to
                        provide services to broad designated communities means that there is the
                        need to comprehend what form topic specific communities take in order to
                        gather and support them in an efficient manner.</hi>

                <p style="text-align:left; ">This paper will present three architectures, from the
                    abstract to the concrete, created in, and for, humanities e-infrastructures. At
                    the most abstract level is the <rs type="software">Reference</rs> Model for the
                    Social Sciences and Humanities Data Infrastructures (RM-SSH), a deceptively
                    simple high-level model which can be used to model everything from a researcher
                    with their laptop to a distributed ERIC. The second architecture, the DARIAH <rs
                        type="software">Reference</rs> Architecture (DARIAH-RA) was created to
                    systematically and formally describe contributions to this e-infrastructure. As
                    such it can be used to describe contributed activities and services as diverse
                    as summer schools and conferences to resource creation and data hosting. The
                    DARIAH-RA is built upon the foundation of the RM-SSH. The most concrete of the
                    architectures is that of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)
                    which currently describes the metadata processing and ingest of archival
                    descriptions and controlled vocabularies into an aggregating portal, both
                    manually and automatically. This information architecture (EHRI-IA) includes
                    process workflows to aid understanding for sustainability as members of the
                    community change over time.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">
                    <hi rend="background(white)">All three architectures, due to their nature of
                        describing distributed infrastructure systems and communities, use a common
                        model: the <rs type="software">Reference</rs> Model of Open Distributed
                        Processing (ODP-RM). This provides a framework to describe the architecture
                        of open, distributed, processing (ODP) infrastructures; whenever possible
                        ODP-RM uses a formal description technique to specify the architecture, in
                        order to guarantee the consistency and reliability of the description.</hi>

                </head>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">DARIAH-EU is the European research infrastructure for
                    the arts and humanities. In 2016 it was recognised as an ERIC and it comprises
                    17 Members and several Cooperating Partners in eight non-member countries. The
                    activities of DARIAH comprise four main strands, namely: 1. training and
                    education; 2. resources, tools and methods made available by and for the
                    research community; 3. policy and advocacy support (on topics such as open
                    science); and finally, 4. a growing transnational community of researchers.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">This paper will focus on the fourth aspect and aims at
                    exploring the case study of the DARIAH-EU Working Groups (henceforth WG) as a
                    model in which research communities organize themselves, given the boundaries
                    and the assets provided by a research infrastructure such as DARIAH. The
                    DARIAH-EU WG are transnational, grass-rooted, self-organized, collaborative
                    groups which have their roots in existing communities of practice. They form the
                    heart of the DARIAH-ERIC community, but at the same time they maintain the
                    existing ties with the (national and local) institutions where the WG members
                    are based.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">The creation of new DARIAH WGs follows the need of
                    communities to foster innovative scholarly practices and to provide the
                    infrastructure to support them. In turn, participation in existing WGs is a
                    means to consolidate infrastructure and scholarship in certain areas of
                    research, and to create or reinforce the network of expertise inside DARIAH. The
                    WG level enables an organizational structure which is not just flexible and
                    dynamic, but also driven by feedback and as such it helps DARIAH to be
                    sustainable. Furthermore the value of the working groups lies in the fact they
                    allow a better alignment between research institutions functioning on a national
                    basis (universities, data centers, data archives, libraries, archives, projects
                    etc…) and the research interests that emerge in international collaborations -
                    the WGs are therefore able to optimize their own research environment by
                    harnessing both national and international horizons. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">In addition, the work of the WGs is considered so
                    central in the development of the Research Infrastructure that in 2017 DARIAH-EU
                    established a funding scheme to provide financial support for their activities,
                    including travel to WG meetings, core developments such as the creation of
                    tools, policy documents or dissemination material. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">This paper will therefore examine the European
                    landscape of the DARIAH WGs, firstly by charting their evolution since 2015 and
                    secondly, by identifying those dynamics of the research community that are the
                    basis for successful collaboration, exchange of information and experiences. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">This presentation also aims to reflect on what the
                    challenges are in the creation and maintenance of such dispersed communities,
                    and therefore it wishes to contribute to a fruitful discussion with other
                    national and international experiences.</p>

                    community in France.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">
                    <hi rend="background(white)">The invention of a national infrastructure, partly
                        based on consortia in France by the TGIR Huma-Num, was an original way of
                        responding to the difficulties of the human and social sciences community in
                        keeping pace with the rapid development of the digital humanities. Starting
                        from the needs, uses and practices of higher education and research
                        stakeholders, consortia have brought together communities from different
                        scientific fields around common challenges. Thus, in 2010, the TGIR Huma-Num
                        launched a call for the creation of consortia around disciplines and/or
                        objects, materials or research data articulated around a human and
                        technological device supported by services.</hi>

                    <hi rend="background(white)">The ways in which these communities have been built
                        and the forms they have taken vary, depending on the context in which they
                        emerged and the nature of the research communities they represent. For
                        example, the Consortia Archives des Ethnologues and ImaGEO started from the
                        objectives of processing and promoting the data of researchers whose
                        resource centres and libraries are depositaries. These consortia were thus
                        constituted by focusing on the promotion of collections and their scientific
                        and public mobilization, while other consortia, such as CAHIER, focused on
                        the corpus of authors and their editorial enhancement to give rise to new
                        research, while others are oriented towards a technology and the ensembles
                        created from it, such as the 3D consortium. Still others have preferred to
                        open up to a wide range of documentary typologies and very diversified modes
                        of exploitation, trying to bring together large user communities, such as
                        the COSME consortium dedicated to the study of medieval sources, or the
                        CORLI consortium bringing together linguists and their work on corpora.</hi>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Each of them has its own mode of governance, internal
                    dynamics and distinct inclusion capacities, but this hybridity has proved to be
                    a strength in working together on issues that cut across all consortia (i.e.
                    data interoperability, legal and ethical issues, pedagogical issues, etc.),
                    which involve them in a transdisciplinary way. In this respect, the FAIR
                    principles are real assets for ensuring the coherence of projects - in
                    particular on legal and ethical issues, long-term preservation or data feedback
                    to civil society. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Dialogue on the digital practices of communities and
                    the transmission of knowledge exchanged or acquired within consortia is now a
                    real challenge at European and international level. New practices that need to
                    be articulated at different levels are emerging, and consortia are the
                    incubators.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left; ">As Neil Fraistat powerfully argues in Matthew K. Gold’s
                    collection of essays <hi rend="italic">Debates in the Digital Humanities</hi>,
                    digital humanities centers have become important laboratories for the
                    application of information technology to humanities research; powerful advocates
                    for the significance of such work; crucial focal points for the theorization of
                    the digital humanities as a field; and local nodes for cyberinfrastructure, or
                    e-science (281). The Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur les humanités
                    numériques (CRIHN) was founded in Québec in the fall of 2013 in order to offer a
                    new structure for over sixty researchers from seven universities working on
                    various aspect of digital culture. These researchers come from various
                    disciplinary backgrounds, primarily in the humanities but with some in social
                    sciences (mainly communication and information studies), but they all have in
                    common a theoretical and practical knowledge of digital humanities that, put
                    under one roof, allow to take the full measure of the digital turn that is
                    characteristic of our times. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">With the series of change to forms and models of
                    publications, the way that information is created, shared, and consulted has
                    undergone some fundamental changes in the last two decades. What is thus
                    required is not only a reconceptualization of a theoretical understanding of
                    digital culture but also the implementation of a series of new tools for
                    disseminating information, for finding it through data mining techniques, for
                    long-term preservation, but also to visualize this mass of data, be it textual,
                    sound-based or visual. These tools should be developed by and for humanities
                    scholars, and be at the same time studied for the way in which they transform
                    future research as well.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">The CRIHN provides a space for engaging these topics on
                    these two levels along the two axes found at the core of the Center’s mandate:
                    “Theorizing the Digital” and “Instruments of knowledge”. The first axis focuses
                    on a theoretical framework for understanding the goals and major shifts that
                    have occurred in digital culture, and offer conceptual tools for describing
                    these changes, specifically in the context of research dissemination. The second
                    axis of the centre has as its main goal to assist researchers in transforming in
                    a very concrete fashion the way they create, analyze, visualize, and disseminate
                    humanities research. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">The CRIHN thus allows a group of researchers to make
                    visible our concept of a platform that can combine discoverability tools with
                    organizational and analytical ones, as well as the modern forms of scholarly
                    dissemination which include an actual social network that goes beyond the use of
                    social media to actually create a live community of researchers that are already
                    involved at the individual level in various projects related to the impact of
                    digital culture on scholarly methods for creating, studying, and disseminating

                <p style="text-align:left; ">Latin America is much more than one of the largest and
                    most diverse regions in the world; it is a symbolic construction that broadly
                    covers Mexico and the countries of Central America, South America and the
                    Caribbean. Latin America’s historical, sociocultural, geographical, economic,
                    and political heterogeneity also reflects the organization of communities of
                    practice with different realities and needs. The recent history of Digital
                    Humanities --as Humanidades Digitales, HD-- in Latin America reflects the
                    growing institutional interest and the promotion of initiatives aimed at the
                    professionalization of academics and the opening of programs, curricula and
                    spaces. On the one hand, there is interest in promoting collaboration and
                    cooperation in the region but on the other, there is no consensus on how this
                    could become a regional reality (not only a local one), as every country in the
                    region has different institutional organizations and priorities. Much of the
                    discourse has focused on “shared problems”, such as obsolete infrastructures,
                    the lack of a grant funding system for the Humanities and disparities in digital
                    literacy among students and scholars. It is important however to also consider
                    shared “strengths” that could allow the development of the field in the region
                    in order to provide both solutions to our problems as well as innovative and
                    unique knowledge within our complex landscape.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Over the past years individuals and associations have
                    discussed possible forms of cooperation in order to build bridges and promote
                    collaboration in Latin America HD. In 2018, during the Digital Humanities
                    Conference held in Mexico City, a meeting was held to discuss the creation of a
                    regional network that could integrate the different experiences that are
                    emerging in Latin America and the Caribbean and continued, some months later, at
                    the HD Conference of the Asociación Argentina de Humanidades Digitales in
                    Rosario, Argentina. These meetings were useful to discuss initial ideas not only
                    about the importance of creating a network but also reflections on what this
                    should look like, what characteristics it should have and how this would differ
                    from other DH networks around the world.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">LatamHD now faces the challenge of defining a shared
                    ethos that can guide the future of HD in the region towards its own character,
                    taking our situated practices and context into account. There is a strong
                    conviction that the HD must assume a fundamental commitment to impact research
                    into cultural objects from a renewed and critical perspective that may not
                    coincide with the methods and practices of Anglophone Digital Humanities. This
                    presentation will be a state of the art of the HD context in Latin America and
                    the Caribbean and will describe LatamHD as a common initiative with some shared
                    next steps and challenges. In particular we will discuss how LatamHD could
                    follow the minka spirit (mink&apos;a or minga in Quechua, minca of Quechua
                    minccacuni, &quot;request help promising something&quot;), in the sense of a
                    pre-Columbian tradition of community and voluntary work with social and
                    reciprocal purposes. For example, the minka may have different purposes for a
                    community, such as the construction of public buildings or helping a person or
                    family, when harvesting or doing other agricultural activities, always with a
                    recompense for those who have helped. The benefit of one should be the benefit
                    of all.</p>

                <head>Talk 6 = When language structures the community: the case of
                    Humanistica</head>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">Founded in 2014, the Francophone association of digital
                    humanities Humanistica occupies a special position in the landscape of DH
                    communities. However, the international – and even intercontinental – nature of
                    the association is neither a way of distinguishing itself from most of the other
                    national or regional organizations nor the affirmation of the unity and the
                    primacy of a research culture beyond the borders of France, the country most
                    naturally associated with this language. The reason for this broad spectrum is
                    simply that the association has been created as a grassroots movement on the
                    basis of an already existing community that brought together DH actors from a
                    wide variety of French-speaking areas. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">It is indeed in 2010, during THATCamp Paris, that a
                    “Manifeste des Digital humanities” was written. This fundamental text for
                    Francophone DH rapidly saw the number of its signatories reach more than 250
                    individuals and institutions. If this first stage of structuring laid the
                    foundation for a common discourse within this growing community, it is after
                    THATCamp Lausanne (2011), Florence (2011) and especially Paris (2012) that many
                    expressed the wish to see the collaboration strengthened within an association.
                    It is then at THATCamp Saint-Malo (2013) that a first provisional committee was
                    elected, before the official founding at DH2014 in Lausanne. Such an obvious
                    link with the philosophy of these “un-conferences”, whose participants often
                    come from many disciplinary, professional and institutional horizons, explains
                    the very broad opening of Humanistica. Its first committee included
                    representatives from France, Canada, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxemburg, and was
                    not limited to tenured profiles, but also included doctoral students and
                    engineers.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">What, then, brings this very heterogeneous community
                    together? And what services can an association provide, on a scale that lies
                    between the traditional institutions of the academic world, national or
                    international infrastructure projects, and global actors? In recent years,
                    together with the growing institutionalization of digital humanities in the
                    French-speaking areas (new curricula and training programmes, laboratories,
                    chairs, events), the number of un-conferences has dropped, making the community
                    harder to grasp. Although its absolute number has increased significantly –
                    nearly 1.400 subscribers to a very active mailing list, institutions gradually
                    integrating digital methods into their syllabi, etc. –, the normalization of DH
                    has changed the meaning of the “community”, formerly strongly united by its
                    minority status. Moreover, the integration of Humanistica within ADHO in 2016,
                    the creation of the <hi rend="italic">Humanités numériques</hi> journal and the
                    recent decision to create an annual event indicate a form of maturity as well as
                    the relative decline of forms of scientific production and exchange that were
                    regarded as characteristic a decade ago (blogging, un-conferences, etc.). </p>
