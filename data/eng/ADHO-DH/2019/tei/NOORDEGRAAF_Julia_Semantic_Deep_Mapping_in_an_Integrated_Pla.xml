            <p>The contributors to this panel are jointly participating in the development of the
                    <ref target="https://amsterdamtimemachine.nl/">Amsterdam Time Machine</ref> - an
                integrated platform to present historical information about people, places,
                relations, events, and objects in its spatial and temporal context, focusing on the
                city of Amsterdam. The web of data on the history of Amsterdam is created by
                systematically linking existing datasets from social and humanities research with
                municipal and cultural heritage data, where possible in the form of Linked Open
                Data. The linked data can then be organized and presented in spatial
                representations, such as geographical and 3D visualizations. The result is a ‘Google
                Earth’ for the past, which allows users to explore the city through space and time,
                at the level of neighbourhoods, streets and even individual houses. Recently, a
                first proof of concept was developed that connects linked data from the Amsterdam
                cultural heritage institutions and various scholarly research projects to a GIS
                infrastructure that provides the historical geographical and topological context for
                these linked datasets. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The conceptual framework offers an instrument for research into urban space as a
                connecting factor for social and cultural processes. Charles Tilly described the
                city as a "privileged site for study of the interaction between large social
                processes and routines of local life." (Tilly, 2015: 161) We offer a research
                platform that operationalizes Tilly’s description by investigating the urban history
                of Amsterdam on a scale that varies from the micro level of a plot, person or place
                to the macro level of broader societal processes in the city as a whole - a
                microscope and telescope in one. Such a research environment offers an unprecedented
                opportunity to explore the relationship between physical and social space and how
                this connection was experienced over time (White, 2010; Bodenhamer et al., 2010 and
                2015). With space as a connecting factor, we provide a concrete illustration of the
                research potential of linking social and economic data to cultural data, allowing
                researchers to study specific historical and cultural phenomena against the
                background of broader societal developments. As such, it facilitates ‘scalable
                digital humanities research’, smoothly navigating historical data from the micro
                level of one location, anecdote or document to the macro level of patterns in large,
                linked datasets that expose broader social and cultural processes. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>This panel focuses on the use of the Amsterdam Time Machine as an infrastructure for
                scalable digital humanities research. The first contribution outlines the
                development of the plot-based geographical infrastructure, including the ways in
                which spatial semantics have been linked up with topological structures and their
                relation with geometries. The following contributions present use cases that focus
                on developments in language, social mobility and leisure activities, in particular
                going to the theatre and cinema. On the one hand, these use cases demonstrate the
                potential of the Amsterdam Time Machine for innovating disciplinary research in
                Linguistics, History and Media Studies. On the other hand, they show how the
                research infrastructure also supports interdisciplinary research, by making a
                connection between the social development of Amsterdam’s historical population
                groups, their language development and their leisure activities in local theatres
                and cinemas. The panel is concluded with a discussion, initiated by Frédéric Kaplan. </p>

            </p>
            <p>Thomas Vermaut, Mark Raat and Hans Mol</p>
            <p>If the Amsterdam Time Machine wants to uphold its claim that it can process all kinds
                of historical data through space and time, it cannot do without a proper
                Geographical Information System (GIS) consisting of viewers, data entry environments
                and 3D visualizations. Such an infrastructure has to be based on the smallest
                geographical unit: the plot or parcel, which can be considered as ‘the atom’ of
                space. In the last decade, much effort has been devoted to georeferencing,
                vectorizing and digitizing the Napoleonic cadastre of 1812-1832 for a series of
                Dutch provinces and cities (Mol, 2015), including Amsterdam. However, since most
                administrative sources for urban history are not listed per plot but per house
                number, it is necessary to connect the house numbers to the cadastral plots. For
                Amsterdam, this meant that the address system of the 1851 census had to be tuned to
                the parcel units of 1832 and to the lists of 1879/1880 with which the current
                Amsterdam street and house numbering system was introduced. All these parcel and
                house numbers are eventually connected to an unique georeferenced point location, in
                order to forestall historical parcel mutations trough time - such as the splitting,
                merge, demolition or construction of buildings. A provisional draft of this combined
                system was already presented in 2013 and could be brought in as the first building
                block for our infrastructure ( <ref target="http://www.hisgis.nl/amsterdam">
                    <hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">www.hisgis.nl/amsterdam</hi>
                </ref>). </p>
            <p>It may seem that these tracks of data processing and homogenizing consecutive address
                systems would lead to a simple historical geometrical tool or ‘coat rack’ to which
                many types of address systems can be hung. Dealing with house numbers, plots and
                persons in a digital way however, poses some serious problems as to addressing the
                spatial uncertainty and the fuzziness of temporal dynamics. Numbering schemes can be
                very complicated in their sequence, with all kinds of relationships between a person
                and a location, distinctions between buildings and residential units, and the
                possible differences between locations and geometries. In our research we have tried
                to solve these problems by using a semantic way of describing relations throughout
                space and time. This is based on a Linked Open Data ontology in which
                spatio-temporal entities (e.g., addresses or cadastral plots) can be related to
                other such units. Abstracting from the spatial implementation of the unit by
                describing it on a semantic level provides an opportunity to link multiple
                geometrical features (point, line and polygon) to it. In our infrastructure,
                therefore, unique georeferenced ID-numbers can be semantically joined to the unit,
                regardless of spatio-temporal fuzziness that may exists towards other geometries.
                Moreover, the LOD approach enabled us to link geographical concepts for streets and
                neighbourhoods introduced at AdamLink ( <ref target="https://adamlink.nl/data">

                    Sociolects</hi>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left;">Marieke van Erp, Kristel Doreleijers and Nicoline van der
                Sijs</p>
            <p>According to the nineteenth-century linguist Johan Winkler (1874) a whopping 19
                dialects were spoken in 19th-century Amsterdam, distributed over the various
                neighbourhoods. Alongside these dialects various sociolects were spoken throughout
                the city: those of the lower, middle and higher classes, and the slang language
                Bargoens. In our project, we are attempting to reconstruct the 19th-century
                Amsterdam dialect and social variation and by doing so we will test if the variation
                is indeed as high as Winkler claimed.</p>
            <p> For this purpose, we have collected over 8,000 phonological and lexical data points
                from sources dating from the end of the 18th century until the beginning of the 20th
                century. Our starting point were the lexical sources on Dutch Bargoens (the argot of
                thieves, beggars and tramps), collected by J.G.M. Moormann (2002). To this we added
                primary and secondary sources about Amsterdam dialects in the 19th century, e.g.,
                glossaries or historical descriptions of the city, the results of a survey on the
                pronunciation and words of the Amsterdam dialect, conducted in 1877, and finally
                recordings of dialect speakers born in the late 19th or early 20th century from the
                Meertens Nederlandse Dialectenbank ( <ref target="https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/ndb/">
                    <hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">www.meertens.knaw.nl/ndb/</hi>
                </ref>) and Nederlandse Liederenbank ( <ref target="http://www.liederenbank.nl/">
                    <hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">www.liederenbank.nl/</hi>
                </ref>). </p>
            <p> The lexical data is converted to Linked Open Data using an adaptation of prior work
                on modelling diachronic data as RDF (Maks et al., 2016) which follows open standards
                such as the Lemon lexicon model for ontologies (Cimiano et al., 2016). For our use
                case, we extend this model with fine grained geographical information from AdamLink
                ( <ref target="https://adamlink.nl/">
                    <hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">adamlink.nl/</hi>
                </ref>), the Amsterdam georeference dataset. The data model is shown in Figure 1. </p>

            <p>Besides modelling challenges, we also face several technical challenges in this
                conversion. One such challenge is for example the fact that dialectologists who have
                first identified the different dialects did not fully specify exactly where each
                dialect was spoken, but rather roughly identified areas as “between streets X and Y
                including their cross-streets.” Anchoring these areas geographically involves
                identifying the locations and lay of these streets in 1874, drawing the areas in a
                GIS system, and mapping the 1874 areas to coordinates. In all of these tasks, we
                benefit from prior GIS work. </p>
            <p> By connecting our language data to other data in the project, we can approach our
                research on the use and spread of data from different angles; for example, by
                investigating the connection to house prices and ‘higher’ sociolects. </p>

            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left;">Ivo Zandhuis and Richard Zijdeman</p>
            <p>Recently, research has been done into the persistence of the elite over time, in
                studies such as Thomas Piketty's <hi rend="italic">Capital in the 21st Century</hi>
                (2013) or Gregory Clark's
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">The Son also Rises </hi>(2014). This subject
                has also been studied in the Netherlands, in particular by Boudien de Vries (1986),
                who conducted research into social mobility among the Amsterdam elite. Although
                innovative for the time, there are two major omissions in this study. It only looks
                at social and economic characteristics and does not take into account geographical
                or cultural context. In this contribution we suggest a method to fill this gap by
                combining existing datasets on elite, status and geography. </p>
            <p>In our research, we used the dataset by Boudien de Vries (1986), containing a sample
                of persons from the Amsterdam electoral rolls of respectively 1854 and 1884
                (available at the City Archives of Amsterdam, finding aid 30272, inventory numbers 1
                and 7, digitally available at <ref
                    target="https://archief.amsterdam/inventarissen/inventaris/30272.nl.html">
                    <hi rend="underline color(1155CC)"
                        >https://archief.amsterdam/inventarissen/inventaris/30272.nl.html</hi>
                </ref>). We converted it into Linked Data and standardized three factors: the
                neighbourhood, the address and the occupation. Thanks to this standardization we
                were able to link three datasets already available on the web. </p>
            <p>Via the neighbourhood we related our observations to the population size per
                neighbourhood, created in the CEDAR project (Meroño Peñuela et al., 2016). Secondly,
                via the addresses we related both a geographical location on the map as well as a
                street name ( <ref target="https://data.adamlink.nl/adamnet/Heritage/">
                    <hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">data.adamlink.nl/adamnet/Heritage/</hi>
                </ref>). Finally, via the standardized occupation (in HISCO) we related a status
                value of the occupation (in HISCAM) (Zijdeman and Lambert, 2010). Standing on the
                shoulders of other data-giants we: (a) visualised the distribution of the elite (b)
                compared the elite density of neighbourhoods in 1854 and 1884, (c) studied the
                relation between status and elite density per neighbourhood. In addition, because of
                the same underlying geographical data we were able to relate our data to other
                datasets in this panel. By incorporating paintings and photographs from heritage
                collections of the City Archives, the Amsterdam Museum and the Rijksmuseum via the
                street name, we can paint a picture of the life of the elite, facilitating a
                presentation of our research for a broader audience. </p>

                Thunnis van Oort and Charlotte Vrielink</p>
            <p>Recent investigations into the circulation, exhibition and reception of film have
                benefited from the increasing availability of (digitized) data and the adjacent
                development of new, computational research methods (Ross et al., 2009), allowing
                scholars to place film within the broader socio-cultural and economic contexts in
                which it emerged (Maltby et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the social composition of
                early cinema audiences has remained hard to grasp, since relevant sources were
                sparse and difficult to analyse in combination. Even less is known about the extent
                to which cinema audiences overlapped with audiences of earlier performing arts, such
                as theatre and music.</p>
            <p>The potential of geospatial research and digital mapping practices has allowed us to
                develop more thorough insights into the historical audiences that flocked to local
                places of entertainment (Horak, 2016), in this case in Amsterdam. The Amsterdam Time
                Machine project has opened up new, integrated research approaches to identify and
                understand the notoriously ephemeral audiences of urban amusements, by providing the
                opportunity to combine heterogeneous cultural datasets (on cinema, theatre and
                nightlife) with social, economic and demographic data to explore correlations
                between venue locations, their cultural offer and the composition of potential local
                audiences. </p>
            <p>Within the collaborative framework of the Amsterdam Time Machine project,
                georeferenced and vectorised historical maps of Amsterdam were made available, on
                which we projected data concerning cinema, theatre and nightlife locations. While
                the online Dutch database <hi rend="italic">Cinema Context</hi> contains information
                on cinemas and screened film programmes in the early 20 <hi rend="superscript"
                    >th</hi> century (Dibbets, 2010), the Special Collections department of the
                Amsterdam University Library published an extensive overview of past theatre
                locations (Logger, 2007). By converting these data into Linked Open Data, the
                locations of entertainment venues were connected to lists of historical Amsterdam
                neighbourhoods and addresses made available within the overarching Amsterdam Time
                Machine project. </p>
            <p> In order to gain a more complete view of the entertainment culture and nightlife
                that existed in Amsterdam, we further mapped fine-grained historical data contained
                in address books and registers of night licenses, that were originally held in the
                Amsterdam City Archives. By additionally combining this with data on the
                socio-economic composition of city neighbourhoods, we traced the correlations
                between the cultural programming of venues, the locations and characteristics of
                bars and restaurants, and the socio-demographic profiles of the neighbourhoods in
                which they were located for selected sample years. </p>
            <p> The establishment of the entertainment areas that we identify, both in the
                historical city’s centre and periphery, can be traced back through time. By
                investigating how sites of public entertainment were formed throughout the 19 <hi
                    rend="superscript">th</hi> century and persisted in the early 20 <hi
                    rend="superscript">th</hi> century, we further characterize these areas
                according to the diversity of culture, consumption and amusement that they offered.
                Additionally, this enables us to connect the emergence and distribution of
                entertainment sites to the socio-economic developments of the city’s neighbourhoods
                from the 19 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to the 20 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                century, and to the findings on class and status in Amsterdam that are uncovered in
                the other Amsterdam Time Machine use cases. </p>

                    Amsterdam Through GIS and 3D</hi>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left;">Ivan Kisjes, Bob Pierik and Danielle van den Heuvel</p>
            <p>Throughout history and across cultures, women are seen as destined for the home
                instead of the street. At the same time, women ventured out regularly to shop, work,
                pray, and play. The project investigates the relationship between women and the
                urban environment in a time when historians believe restrictions on female movement
                greatly intensified, by comparing gendered street use in early modern Amsterdam and
                Tokyo (Edo) between 1600 and 1850 (Van den Heuvel, 2018). It employs an innovative
                approach to studying the gendering of urban space by digitally reconstructing street
                use. This paper discusses the data model and first outcomes of the research on
                Amsterdam.</p>
            <p>Information is gathered from a large variety of sources (notarial archives, diaries,
                historic prints and paintings etc.). To accommodate such disparate information, an
                event-based, tripartite data model is used: events, people and locations. This makes
                it possible to enter all relevant information from the sources and provides a
                flexible way to coherently connect such complex data in a way that makes
                quantitative analysis possible (Carus and Ogilvie, 2009; Fiebranz et al., 2011).</p>
            <p> All this information is put into a spatial database (PostgreSQL/PostGIS), making it
                possible to analyse movement of people and events through space and time (Kim,
                2015). Interfaces specific to the source type (an annotation interface for images, a
                transcription one for notarial sources) were developed for entering the data, and
                connected to the same database. Additional GIS techniques (such as automatic
                vectorization of maps) provides contextual data to which the events can be
                related.</p>
            <p>The data model facilitates a long-term intersectional analysis of gendered mobility
                and street use. We are able to show to what extent men and women stuck to areas of
                the same social class as those where they themselves resided. This provides
                important insights into how gendered (im)mobility was dependent on social
                segregation (Lesger and Van Leeuwen, 2012). We can also reconstruct seasonality in
                movement, as well as how Amsterdam’s street life changed during the course of a
                day.</p>
            <p>Finally, 3D models of early modern Amsterdam allow for an investigation of the
                relationship between the urban form and activities in certain urban spaces. For
                instance, it helps determine the ‘hiddenness’ of streets, to be able to investigate
                if particular events types occurred predominantly in unobserved spaces (Cowan,
                2011). A reconstruction of the early modern street network furthermore makes it
                possible to do spatial network queries like shortest path analysis (how far did men
                and women venture from their residences at various times of day?) and makes it
                possible to estimate how busy a particular street was at a certain time of day
                (Dijkstra, 1959).</p>
            <p>The project uniquely records the events and people hitherto largely unmentioned in
                history because of their peripheral appearance in historic documents, and provides
                new insight into the historic urban environment in a quantitative way. The data
                gathered in the project is essential to the framework, as it consists of the daily
                goings-on in the streets of the historic city.</p>
