                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>This panel explores several research projects that use video games and digital
                    game making tools as methods for engaging learners of all ages with digitised
                    collections from libraries, archives and museums to facilitate new
                    understandings of historical and cultural events, or create new media
                    adaptations and interpretations of classic literary works. </p>
                <p>The panel includes presentations from collaborative research projects, which
                    investigate how video game software can be used in different learning
                    environments to actively engage children, young people and adults with social
                    issues, history and literature. These projects include a presentation on British
                    Library digital initiatives, such as the Off the Map game design competition,
                    online interactive fiction writing jams and their interactive fiction writing
                    summer schools. </p>
                <p>There are then two speakers who have worked collaboratively with the British
                    Library on educational video game projects. <hi rend="italic">Playing

                    is a project that has produced their own digital game authoring tool for
                    schools, MissionMaker, which enables users to make their own adaptations of
                    classic literary texts. Whereas educational Minecraft project <hi rend="italic"
                        >Litcraft</hi>, led by Lancaster University, uses the popular Minecraft
                    gaming platform to build accurate scale models of authorial maps from classic
                    works of literature; which are then used as virtual environments for classroom
                    learning activities set in locations of the book narratives. </p>
                <p>The fourth speaker examines educational videogames in India and includes an
                    introduction to a new game project from the University of Helsinki. Who are
                    collaborating with an Indian game development studio, to create a game based on
                    the Indian festival Durgapuja, which is designed for international audiences and
                    for use by numerous academic disciplines, for teaching aspects of contemporary
                    Indian society and culture. [280 words]</p>

                <head>Places of inspiration; digital interactive writing and literary game making in
                    libraries</head>
                <p>Interactive fiction and literary game making encourage writers and readers to
                    explore new ways of engaging with stories and narratives. Furthermore, digitised
                    collections from galleries, libraries, archives and museums can be used to
                    create new media adaptations and interpretations of classic literary works.
                    There are a growing number of easy to use digital tools offering new ways for
                    library users to curate and tell stories beyond the printed book and the spoken
                    word. This paper is an overview and evaluation of experiments and
                    collaborations, which have used British Library digital collections in creative
                    projects.</p>
                <p>It covers the Off the Map game design competition, which set UK higher education
                    students the task of creating video games, text adventures and virtual
                    interactive environments using digitised British Library ‘assets’ including
                    maps, views, texts, illustrations and recorded sounds as creative inspiration.
                    These competitions were themed to coincide with British Library exhibitions on
                    gothic literature, William Shakespeare and <hi rend="italic">Alice’s Adventures
                        in Wonderland</hi>. Submitted entries offered completely new interpretations
                    of the Library’s collections and for the <hi rend="italic">Alice’s Adventures in
                        Wonderland</hi> theme a playable version of the winning game was included in
                    the physical exhibition in the Library. </p>

Most entries were interactive fiction, 2D and 3D explorer games, but other types of submissions included a digital headstone generator, an atmospheric audio soundscape and a table-top role playing storytelling game based on a Victorian séance. Participants were encouraged to use the British Library&apos;s vast collection of public domain images available on Flickr Commons. Often the images, like the gothic novel genre, was used as inspiration. However, some works incorporated the images as an integral part of the story; </hi>

                    summer schools held at the British Library in 2017 and 2018. Using Twine, an
                    open-source programme for writing interactive narratives, over five intense
                    days, adult participants learned how to build non-linear digital story games
                    with expert tuition from specialists in interactive storytelling. [465

                <head>Playing Beowulf: gaming the library</head>
                <p>This paper will present outcomes from two research projects, which developed a
                        <rs type="software">Unity</rs>-based games authoring tool, MissionMaker, to
                    allow users to make their own adaptations of classic literary texts. One of
                    these, in collaboration with the British Library, was the Anglo-Saxon poem <hi
                        rend="italic">Beowulf</hi>; the other, still in progress, features the
                    Shakespeare play <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>. The talk will draw on examples
                    from a range of participants of different ages, arguing that game-making can
                    transform engagement with such texts, in terms of understanding of narrative,
                    literary value and the processes of reading and interpretation. The projects
                    also suggested the value of games as a way of animating the archive: of
                    inserting historical fictions into contemporary landscapes of play. Finally, the
                    conjunction of literary adaptation, game design and rule-making, also suggested
                    how games allow a bridging of the notorious and persistent arts-science divide:
                    how literary narrative can become computable, and how computer science can craft
                    poetic forms. [153 words] </p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Litcraft</hi>: re-engaging children with literature through
                    Minecraft </head>
                <p>This paper will be about a project undertaken in partnership with The British
                    Library and The Wordsworth Trust as part of the <hi rend="italic">Chronotopic
                        Cartographies</hi> project (which features as another panel proposal). The
                    paper is centred on <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Litcraft </hi>(also
                    offered as a workshop at DH 2019) which uses the popular Minecraft gaming
                    platform to build accurate scale models of authorial maps from classic works of
                    literature (e.g. <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi>; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kenzuke’s Kingdom</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi>). Impact is
                    achieved by re-engaging children (primarily though not exclusively) with
                    literature in a model of positive reinforcement that makes works accessible in
                    entirely new ways, combining the textual and the digital. Reading and writing
                    are integrated with an immersive experience of the literary world. </p>
                <p>The paper will be in two parts, relating to our work with museums and libraries.
                    The first part articulates the original development of the
                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Litcraft </hi>project out of a pilot
                    project called <hi rend="italic">Lakescraft</hi>, which used an Ordnance Survey
                    Minecraft map of the Lake District to embed interdisciplinary activities into
                    the landscape. The <hi rend="italic">Litcraft</hi> project further builds on
                    this model directly in work undertaken for The Wordsworth Trust, Grasmere. As
                    part of the re-design of the museum site for 2020 we are creating a digital
                    resource that maps Wordsworth’s autobiographical poetic memories (“Spots of
                    Time”) in the landscape of the lakes. This resource will then be integrated in a
                    central corridor between museum spaces to engage children with the landscape in
                    an imbedded way through <hi rend="italic">Litcraft</hi> (using the O.S. map and
                    placing poetry within the landscape) but will also connect children actively to
                    items in the museum itself. </p>
                <p rend="List Paragraph">The second part of the paper will be on our work with
                    libraries through the “Litcraft in Libraries” scheme. As well as having the
                    British Library as a major partner we also work with five different regions in
                    the UK to deliver the resource to children through the library space. The paper
                    will describe the resource created for Robert Louis Stevenson’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi>. In preparation for the immersive
                    activity, children read and study the character of Jim Hawkins (the boy hero);
                    they read the chapter “My Shore Adventure” in which Jim hides in the boat and
                    runs ashore against the wishes of the adults. Children then enter the Minecraft
                    world (an accurate scale replica of the map of Treasure Island given at the
                    start of Stevenson’s book) and themselves run all over it finding various
                    objects and using Stevenson’s map to help them negotiate the digital world.
                    Textual and immersive worlds work <hi rend="italic">together</hi> to increase
                    empathetic and spatial understanding and motivate both reading and writing. We
                    will talk through the resources themselves as well as the range of ways they
                    have been delivered across libraries. </p>
                <p rend="List Paragraph">
                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Litcraft </hi>has the most powerful
                    impact on pedagogy and on individual readers – potentially changing reluctant

                <head>The complexities of video games as teaching tools: educational game
                    development for teaching indian culture and society </head>
                <p>While DH is often understood to first and foremost develop and provide digital
                    tools and methods to support Humanities (and Social Sciences) informed research,
                    in a wider understanding, the discipline also comprises the researching of the
                    interconnections of digital technology and culture at large. This includes video
                    games, as today, games actively contribute to construct perceptions of norms,
                    values, identities, and society in general. Games are increasingly complex,
                    interactive virtual worlds which, among other things, can be used for
                    transmitting information or knowledge about certain subjects. </p>
                <p>Especially educational games do so in a very conscious and straightforward way.
                    They are developed specifically to either teach or, in a more subtle way, to
                    draw attention to and offer background knowledge on certain topics. A number of
                    studies highlight the additional benefits of the immersion and emotional factors
                    which educational games offer, as an additional value in education as compared
                    to traditional teaching. </p>
                <p>For instance, currently and within the larger video game boom in India, we find
                    an innovative development: some pioneering games from especially so-called indie
                    (independent) studios produce educational games, which take up specific issues
                    in society and try to bring them to the awareness of a broader audience – to
                    educate a larger audience about a specific problem or issue. The game MISSING: A
                    GAME FOR A CAUSE is a perfect example for this. The game is part of an art
                    project, which was initiated to draw attention to the abduction of girls in
                    India. In India today, about 3 million girls are trafficked every year. This
                    game attests for the changing landscape in Indian game development, and for the
                    increasing awareness of game developers just how much games can interrelate with
                    society. </p>
                <p>Recently, we find additional efforts also in the academic sector. This paper will
                    introduce to the first educational video game for teaching contemporary Indian
                    society and culture, which is in the final development phase. The joint effort
                    of the speaker and an Indian game development studio produced a game introducing
                    to selected core aspects of the highly popular Indian festival Durgapuja. This
                    game version is targeted at university students with little or no background
                    knowledge on the subject yet; that is, it is designed as an introduction to
                    contemporary Indian culture and society. The game will be available through open
                    access and can be used internationally and in numerous disciplines. [393
