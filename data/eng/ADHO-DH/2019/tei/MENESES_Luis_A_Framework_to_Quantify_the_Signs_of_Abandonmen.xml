                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>As researchers in the digital humanities we have been successful in building
                    online components for our work. However, we have failed in making it a priority
                    to devise a plan to gracefully discard our online components once we no longer
                    need them. Thus, many of the online projects in the digital humanities have an
                    implied planned obsolesce —which means that they will degrade over time.</p>
                <p>Previous work presented in Digital Humanities 2017 and 2018 has explored the
                    abandonment, and the average lifespan, of online projects in the digital
                    humanities using metadata from HTTP response headers (Meneses and Furuta, 2017)
                    and contrasted how things have changed over the course of a year (Meneses et
                    al., 2018). We believe that managing and characterizing the degradation of
                    online digital humanities projects is a complex problem that demands further
                    analysis because the methods for identifying change in the Web do not fully
                    apply; and the end of life for a digital humanities project may or may not be
                    indicated by updates in its content and tools. </p>
                <p>In this sense “abandonment” is not necessarily a sufficient designation —as there
                    are different nuances involved. We have seen many cases of successful projects
                    in digital humanities that are shifting their focus from active development to
                    data management (for example: http://cervantes.tamu.edu and
                    http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/). These are cases where a project’s online presence
                    has not received updates for some time but its online tools are stable and
                    continue to be accessed by its users. In this case, the lack of updates and new
                    content is not a signal of abandonment. These are examples of why the rules for
                    traditional resources do not fully apply and new metrics are needed to identify
                    issues concerning online projects in the digital humanities.</p>
                <p>In this abstract, we go one step further into exploring the collectively shared
                    distinctive signs of abandonment to quantify the planned obsolesce of online
                    digital humanities projects. For this purpose, we have created a framework that
                    collectively quantifies their signs of abandonment. This study aims to answer
                    three questions. First, can we systematically identify the signals of abandoned
                    projects using computational methods? Second, can the degree of abandonment be
                    quantified? And third, what features are more relevant than others when
                    identifying instances of abandonment?</p>

                <head>Methodology</head>
                <p>A complete listing of research projects in the Digital Humanities does not exist.
                    However, the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations publishes a Book of
                    Abstracts after each Digital Humanities conference as a PDF. Each one of these
                    volumes can be treated as a compendium of the research that is carried out in
                    the field. To create a dataset, we downloaded the Books of Abstracts from 2006
                    to 2018. Then we proceeded to extract the text from these documents using Apache
                    Tika (Apache Software Foundation, 2018) and parse the unique URLs for each Web
                    resource using regular expressions. </p>
                <p>Then we periodically created a set of WARC files (International Organization for
                    Standardization, 2017) for each resource using Wget (Free Software Foundation,
                    2018). The WARC files are systematically processed and analyzed using <rs
                        type="software">Python</rs> (van Rossum, 1995) and Apache Spark (Apache
                    Software Foundation, 2017) to create a hash that represents their contents
                    —pinpointing changes over time— and to extract the analytics that we used in our
                    statistical analysis. More specifically, our analysis has two parts that
                    incorporate the retrieved HTTP response codes, number of redirects, a detailed
                    examination of the contents and links returned by traversing the base node,
                    external resources, HTTP headers and linked files. Figure 1 shows the workflow
                    that we used in our framework to quantify the sings of abandonment. </p>

                <p>First, we carried out a preliminary classification of the websites into two
                    groups depending on their correctness according to their HTTP response codes:
                    valid (responses in the 200 and 300 range) and decayed (all other response
                    codes). If a Web resource reports more than one redirect, we placed it in the
                    decayed category. This is a preliminary classification because a Web resource
                    could return an HTTP response code implying correctness while showing erroneous
                    content (Meneses et al., 2012: 404) —justifying the second part of our analysis
                    where we cluster the contents of each Web resource in the valid category. We
                    perform the clustering using topic modeling and Term frequency–Inverse document
                    frequency (Tf-Idf). </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="Body_Text_Indent_Char" xml:space="preserve">The textual contents and the links associated with shared resources are the most obvious feature for clustering. </hi>Previous
                    work has shown that shared resources are the first to disappear from the Web
                    (SalahEldeen and Nelson, 2012) —which we interpret as premature indications of
                    degradation.
                    <hi rend="Body_Text_Indent_Char" xml:space="preserve">To detect these early signs, we generated topic and term frequency models to examine the similarity among the documents in a given project (the contents of the base node and the metadata and the contents of the child nodes). We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the content of the text </hi>
                    (Blei et al., 2003)
                    <hi rend="Body_Text_Indent_Char" xml:space="preserve">and a simple Tf-Idf ranking function to measure and compare them. This ranking function is based on adding the Tf-Idf values for the documents linked to a Web resource, which were calculated using the terms from the topic modelling as a vocabulary. </hi>This
                    combination metrics and techniques allow us to compare and assess the degree of
                    change of online digital humanities projects over time. </p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">In this this study we aim to computationally identify
                    the indicators of the abandonment of digital humanities projects —a very
                    specific domain— as well as quantify their degrees of neglect. It is important
                    to highlight that not all projects are equal and thus require different levels
                    of attention. Previous work in this area was based on the metadata from HTTP
                    headers —emphasizing the need for a framework that utilizes robust metrics to
                    identify the collectively shared indicators of degradation. We intend this study
                    to be a step forward towards better preservation mechanisms and for adopting
                    strategies for the planned obsolesce of digital humanities projects.</p>
