                <head>Overview</head>
                <p>In seeking to understand human activity using computational methods, researchers
                    in the Digital Humanities must inevitably wrestle with the complexities of space
                    and time. Considered separately, these situating vectors of human experience
                    pose challenges of perspective, direction, and, of course, uncertainty: both in
                    how they are perceived and in the form of their documentation. When combined,
                    and addressed as a cognitive matrix within which knowledge is constructed and
                    narrative accounts are traced, that complexity is compounded. The challenges
                    entailed are conceptual, theoretic and practical, and the panel aims to bring
                    these diverse approaches into a productive dialogue.</p>
                <p>The panelists will offer prismatic perspectives on primarily historical human
                    experience and knowledge construction in relation to varying notions space-time,
                    in six short papers. These will afford a keyhole view into the research
                    undertaken from each of the projects, as it is described in the abstracts, but
                    specified for its particular resonance with the work of one of more of the other
                    participants. Some participants will report on research in progress, others on
                    work produced and evaluated, while one surveys the work of past pioneers with an
                    argument for its reconsideration. Collectively, they will inform a lively
                    dialogue bridging knowledge representation, data modelling, semantic annotation,
                    machine learning, urbanism, social and cultural history, literary and courtroom
                    chronotopes, and critical artistic and design practice.</p>
                <p>The studies are concerned with how space-time defines and is defined by human
                    experiences: of pleasure and trauma, creativity and crime, security and
                    insecurity; and how it is represented in textual, graphical, audiovisual and
                    extended reality forms, empirically and imaginatively. They address questions of
                    mobility, place-making, displacement and co-presence, as sites of complex
                    space-time relations, in every century from the seventeenth to the present. All
                    though, with one exception, confront common challenges around how best to
                    identify, extract, model and compare the spatio-temporal data that inheres in
                    the historical or contemporary record. And that one exception serves as a
                    keystone, suggesting possible solutions to some of these questions by treating
                    space-time as an interface metaphor that may render the multi-dimensionality of
                    humanistic data legible in terms that are disciplinarily congenial.</p>
                <p>It is hoped from the resulting dialogue between panel members will produce some
                    pointers to how organising concepts and frameworks from one approach -
                    chronotopes, dimensionality reduction, thick-mapping, fuzziness and spatial
                    syntax - may prove unexpectedly applicable across conventional boundaries, and
                    how these may be usefully mediated by new or existing digital tools and
                    techniques.</p>

                <p>Why are some places and periods considered to be more innovative than others? In
                    addressing this question, humanities scholars and social scientists have pointed
                    to a complex interplay of historical circumstances, urban conditions, talented
                    individuals, as well as local supporting institutions (Hall 1998; O’Hagan and
                    Hellmanzik 2008; O’Hagan and Borowiecki 2010; Serafinelli and Tabellini 2018).
                    Individual studies tend to favor the one factor over the other, but collectively
                    they increasingly employ spatial concepts and methods, visible in the mapping of
                    spatial clustering, social networks, and migration patterns of actors or objects
                    (Currid and Williams 2010; Brosens et al. 2017; Williams 2018). In these
                    approaches, it is often assumed that urban space facilitated the creation and
                    the transmission of innovation over time and place, but it is still unclear how
                    this would have worked in practice. Where and how were (new) ideas negotiated
                    and challenged, adopted and adapted? Would this have differed across time and
                    place? If so, how can we present the changes over time and space?</p>
                <p>Inspired by time-space geography (Pred 1984; Hägerstrand 1985), we propose a
                    methodological framework for embedding complex spatial thinking and
                    visualizations into existing research on the historical relationships between
                    place and innovation, and create multi-layered deep maps with Geographical
                    Information System (GIS) to capture the dynamics and the uncertainties in all
                    its complexity (Bodenhamer et al. 2015). And we test it by dynamic digital
                    mapping of a particularly lively and well-researched time and place:
                    seventeenth-century Amsterdam. At the heart of our approach is a visual
                    representation of cultural production and consumption as dynamic and performed
                    activities embedded in (semi-)public life. We argue that we can observe and
                    represent these activities in specific private and public urban spaces
                    (so-called cultural venues), and that, more broadly, a focus on events and
                    venues contributes to the integration of temporal and spatial perspectives in
                    the digital humanities (Nijboer and Rasterhoff 2018). After all, it is in
                    specific venues in specific urban environments that time and space cross paths,
                    because historical activities relating to the cultural life of urban dwellers
                    can only take place in a physical location on a particular time (Crow 1985). </p>
                <p>The early modern period is, moreover, particularly interesting and challenging,
                    because there were few formal cultural venues, as in the case of Amsterdam. Deep
                    mapping culture venues in early modern Amsterdam forces us to explore available
                    sources, and, more importantly, to rethink how we can analyze and visualize time
                    and space while allowing for uncertainties and ambiguities. Historians have
                    observed that many activities that we might now consider as “cultural” such as
                    theatre, music, but also art auctions and dice games were taking place in
                    taverns or inns ( <hi rend="italic">herbergen</hi>), which in turn were often
                    run by cultural entrepreneurs or their family members (Hell 2017). We
                    investigate the role of these venues in the city’s various creative industries,
                    and as spaces where entertainment and cultural consumption may have converged to
                    give way to popular innovations. </p>

                <head>Extracting the historical experience of urban and domestic space-time from the
                    Old Bailey corpus by a novel application of machine learning (B) </head>
                <p rend="DH-AuthorAffiliation">Alex Butterworth and Simon Wibberley</p>
                <p>The courtroom records of the Old Bailey teem with the everyday life of eighteenth
                    and nineteenth century London, around those moments when mundane existence is
                    more or less abruptly intersected by acts of criminal transgress. Dense
                    sequences of human experience are described, often in multiple accounts, in an
                    attempt to forge a consensus version of events. These are transcriptions of the
                    legal process as it remediates the configuration of space-time that defined the
                    original criminal event, through the formalising chronotopes of the courtroom.
                    The temporal and spatial dimensions of the original events, already subject to
                    uncertainty and contestation, become further layered and involuted through
                    narrative testimony. </p>
                <p>These concatenated constructions of space-time can be disentangled by close
                    reading. However, it is only when the corpus is viewed at scale that it reveals
                    historically significant patterns of human behaviour within the urban and
                    domestic environment: the lived experience of the historical actors, and the
                    micro-incidents that comprise it. To access these insights, we are developing a
                    novel methodology for the semantic annotation of the historical corpus of the
                    Old Bailey that employs supervised machine/deep learning technologies: a process
                    in which the humanist scholar is continuously involved in assessing and
                    categorising outputs, to iteratively generate additional training data, in a
                    virtuous cycle. </p>
                <p>The approach deploys a collection of advanced natural language processing methods
                    to automatically annotate textual elements in the initial phase. The subsequent
                    examination of these entities by their distribution, individually by type and in
                    combination, within the texts and in relation to their discourse structure, make
                    it possible to identify and code fragments of a semantic graph as representing
                    events. These events, in turn, can be mapped or otherwise visualised in their
                    physical context - of crime scene or courtroom reconstruction - and further
                    analysed and validated using measures of coherence and plausibility that
                    leverage the analyst’s intuitive knowledge of space-time relations.</p>
                <p>This method will generate a rich set of semantic annotations, enabling new kinds
                    of research questions to be posed of the corpus, at three levels of granularity: </p>
                <p>macro: eg. what patterns can be discerned in the spatial distributions of event
                    over time (of day, year or century), or in the frequency of reference in
                    specific types of courtroom discourse?</p>
                <p>meso: eg. what types of events, considered as assemblages of activity, place,
                    time and person, characterise particular crimes?</p>
                <p>micro: eg. what events and locations characterise the itineraries of thieves and
                    their victims, and what causes deviation from these norms?</p>

                    Charles Perin</p>
                <p>Since 2014, a major archive has undertaken the digitisation at scale of analogue,
                    hand-written War Diaries from the First World War (WWI), documenting the story
                    of the British Army and its units on the Western Front, using an interactive
                    crowd-sourcing platform (https://www.operationwardiary.org/). Crowd-workers have
                    digitised more than a million diary pages. During this process, essential
                    information about military units, including labels for casualties, unit
                    strength, weather, everyday army life, soldiers names and grades, military
                    activities at the front and non-military activities behind the line, have been
                    tagged and annotated. However, the transcription process introduced uncertainty
                    on many levels due to missing records or pages, misspellings, illegible passages
                    or lost diaries. </p>
                <p>Some uncertainties derive from the particular type of data that has been
                    gathered, the circumstances of its creation, and its post-processing. These may
                    be the result of human errors: the British soldiers who wrote the diaries made
                    misspellings, faithfully transcribed, while the crowd-workers also introduced
                    new typos, leading to further ambiguity regarding names of people and locations.
                    Or they may be intrinsic to the historical record, as where spatio-temporal
                    uncertainty arises when several places are mentioned on one single day in the
                    diary. Close reading is then required to determine in which order the places
                    were visited by the troops or whether a place was mentioned as a troop location
                    or other reasons.</p>
                <p>These types of uncertainty may lead to ambiguous geographic coordinates during
                    the geo-referencing process (assigning a numeric geographic location to a place
                    name). As part of the collaboration between Archives and its university partner,
                    an approach was developed that we term GeoBlobs: an abstract representation of
                    spatio-temporal data, which visualises uncertain spatio-temporal data derived
                    from the handwritten military diaries (Liem et al., 2018). </p>
                <p>GeoBlobs offer one possible solution to these problems. They are an abstract
                    representation of moving entities on a map with uncertain positions. Instead of
                    showing a unit at a given point in time, GeoBlobs convey an unordered estimation
                    of the possible locations over a temporal window using enclosed shapes, or
                    blobs. To this end, we apply heuristics to weigh each location within the
                    temporal window. At the representation stage, it is possible to specify
                    dynamically which (weighted) sets of location are considered to form the
                    GeoBlobs. For other visualization approaches of spatio-temporal uncertainty in a
                    cultural heritage context please refer to Windhager et al. (2018).</p>
                <p>Different form and style parameters can influence the visual appearance of
                    GeoBlobs and their semantics. Uncertainty can be expressed through sketchy or
                    blurry styles, while the use of multiple GeoBlobs allows us to compare units and
                    show different probabilities. Animation or overlays communicate additional
                    context like military (e.g. fighting, raiding, fixing trenches) or non-military
                    activities (e.g. playing football, boxing, resting, washing).</p>
                <p>The GeoBlob project aims to reveal stories of the soldiers’ day-to-day life
                    behind the lines, which will lead towards a narrative visualization (Riche et
                    al., 2018) for communicating “the life behind the trenches” that cannot be found
                    in our history books (Grayson, 2016).</p>

                <p rend="DH-AuthorAffiliation">Duncan Hay and Alex Butterworth</p>
                <p>The mapping of literary texts has become a commonplace of Digital Humanities
                    research in recent years. Whilst many projects have interpreted this mapping as
                    the accurate georesolution of textual name references, others have used
                    computational methods to explore the place-making mediated by text. Often, these
                    approaches have aimed to locate the text, using GIS methods.</p>
                <p>This study abstracts itself further from an indexical relationship to the
                    physical world, focusing instead on the narratological role of chronotopic
                    relationships within literary texts: how varying modes of time and space are
                    deployed and inter-operate, curdling together to create and recall the textual
                    experience of situated event. It explores this construction of narrative through
                    the process of designing an interactive data visualisation interface, using
                    semantic annotations of a literary text, manually produced during an initial
                    process of close reading. The annotations encode semantic entities as types of
                    place, time, person and event, along with textual cues and referential clues,
                    more or less explicit and probabilistically interpreted by the reader.</p>
                <p>Conceived as an experimental exploration of the problems and potential analytical
                    value of the computational modelling and visualisation of literary chronotopes,
                    this phase of the project addresses texts that are manageable in length but pose
                    significant challenges: allusion and anaphora, uncertainty and ambiguity,
                    recurrence and duplication, cognitive lacunae. It embraces the notion of
                    literary text as cognitive scaffolding, whose effect lies as much in the absence
                    of description and specificity as its presence, while grounding its analysis
                    through the identification of chronotopic anchor points within more fluid
                    constructions of contextualising time and space.</p>

                    poem adheres to the simple past tense in its progressive dynamic, yet operates

                    and the framing device of a confessional future, with spatial allusion playing a
                    complex role. The paper will offer critical reflections on designing exploratory
                    visualisations of fragments of semantic graphs in fluid and dynamic

                <head>Only Expansion: Composing Temporal Structures For Augmented Audio Experiences
                    In The Anthropocene (E) </head>
                <p rend="DH-AuthorAffiliation">Duncan Speakman</p>
                <p>This paper will present the practice based research outcomes of an augmented
                    audio urban artwork, offering an account of how merging realtime processing of
                    the listener’s immediate sonic environment with remote field recordings can
                    offer new critical approaches to temporal perception and contemporary ecological
                    thinking.</p>
                <p>The artwork under examination uses custom mobile technology to create an urban
                    audio walk that both remixes the immediate sound environment of the audience and
                    combines it with field recordings from remote locations. In the experience
                    participants wear headphones that also contain binaural microphones, the signal
                    from these microphones is fed through DSP software in bespoke handheld devices
                    before being fed back to the headphones. In this way the voices of passing
                    pedestrians might become a resonant choir, or a bus engine may form a rhythmic
                    counterpoint. The field recordings are sourced from a series of international
                    locations all undergoing major environmental shifts, so the sound of the wind in
                    the city where the audience experiences the piece may become merged with wind
                    recordings from the Tunisian Sahara. Through the combination of field recordings
                    with processed and raw microphone signals, an interface is created between the
                    listeners presence, the immediate space and remote locations. </p>
                <p>Within the arc of the composition the audience is invited to seek out types of
                    location through textual prompts often as simple as single words such as “drift”
                    or “border”. In this way the work offers a site responsive rather than site
                    specific experience, and the absence of cardinal guidance forces the audience to
                    navigate the urban space through direct physical and sensory engagement. Drawing
                    on over a decade of international practice in the creation of locative audio
                    walks by the author, the paper considers new compositional structures for works
                    using augmented audio technologies, focusing on the layering of different
                    temporalities within urban environments. </p>
                <p>The effect that is produced when the audience’s lived experience of walking
                    through the work are layered with the timescales represented within the field
                    recordings speaks to Timothy Morton’s idea that we are currently living with the
                    uncanny sense of existing on two timescales simultaneously. Our everyday human
                    actions feeding into processes that extend far beyond our lifetimes. This
                    experience is considered within the context of Anja Kanngieser’s proposal that
                    “sound can help to differentiate the sweeping universality - and hence the
                    seeming unchangeability - that the Anthropocene poses,” and that “sound renders
                    apparent that the world is not for humans. The world is rather with humans.”
                    (Kanngeiser, 2015).</p>
                <p>
                    <lb/>By situating the audience within the layered temporality of the work, not
                    just physically, but as an active contributor to the soundscape, this inquiry
                    offers new approaches to augmented audio as a way of inhabiting, communicating
                    and knowing an entangled world. It begins not with distant stories being
                    collected and delivered, but at the site of the audience experience, and expands
                    outwards from there through the transversality of sound. </p>

                        <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century and this paper will survey that
                    tradition for how it may inform contemporary approaches in the digital
                    humanities. </p>
                <p>At the turn of the twentieth century, scholars from diverse disciplines were
                    concerned with knowledge organization at a global level, aiming to reconcile new
                    insights from evolutionary theory, the emerging disciplines of psychology and
                    physics (with its novel notions of spacetime) and traditional philosophical and
                    humanist epistemology. Three-dimenstional objects and imagistic thinking played
                    a crucial role in the classificatory systems and knowledge modelling developed
                    by Paul Otlet, Patrick Geddes, Wilhelm Ostwald, H.G.Wells and others. Their
                    approach was conceived to allow both automatic information retrieval and
                    analysis, and a synthesising of knowledge that retained its dynamic complexity.
                    Novel techniques of dimension reduction nevertheless challenged the
                    multidimensional habits of humanistic thought - a tension that the mathematician
                    Shiyali Ranganathan, who developed the multidimensional Colon classification,
                    described in 1951:</p>
                <p>“Thought is multi-dimensional. But we are one-dimensional beings – that is we
                    still prefer all things to be handled to be arranged in one-dimension […] This
                    means that classification is essentially a transformation of a many-dimensional
                    universe into a uni-dimensional, uni-directional one. Machine tools are expected
                    to perform this transformation.”</p>
                <p>As the computer proved its capacity to analyse large quantities of scientific
                    information and to make complex calculations, there was criticism of the
                    “efficient” approaches developed by the information sciences. Gerard Cordonnier
                    (1944) had already tried to define “intellectual space” and advocated
                    classification as a collection ordered by points of view. Joseph Licklider
                    (1965) would reassert the value of spatial analogies in the face of linear
                    methods, observing the relative absence from the contemporary debate of
                    reflections on concepts such as “information space,” “semantic space” or “the
                    space of knowledge.” Parallel to these (visual) conceptualizations of space in
                    library and information sciences, historians formulated theories of time and
                    periodization (Pot 1951, 1999), distinguishing types of duration (Braudel, see
                    Tomich, 2012). Their aim was to equip their field of conceptual modelling with
                    rigorous defined spatial metaphors of multidimensionality: to imagine what
                    Kubler described as the “shape of time.” </p>
                <p>It was, in some senses, the conjunction of these aspirations that Ted Nelson had
                    sought to reify in Project Xanadu (1960s to 80s), espousing the use of viewable
                    units of meaning: “vunits” whose contents are linkable and transclusible
                    (showing their contents). By 2007, Nelson would become frustrated that the World
                    Wide Wide had come to imitate “paper under glass” rather than a vision of true
                    hypertexutality. This paper argues that a decade on, as the humanities
                    increasingly embrace semantic web technologies, reflection on past attempts to
                    explore multi-dimensional conceptualization of time and space can significantly
                    inform current aspirations for the inclusive modelling of complexity in
                    humanistic enquiry.</p>
