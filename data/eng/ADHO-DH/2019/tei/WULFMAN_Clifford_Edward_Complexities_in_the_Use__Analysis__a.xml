                <head>Panel introduction</head>
                <p>The theme of this conference is complexities, and there are few printed media as
                    complex as newspapers and magazines. They are, generally, serial publications
                    (and thus have a complex temporal dimension not often found in other
                    publications), frequently with miscellaneous content and complex page layout,
                    and often entailing complex publication relationships among authors, editors,
                    and publishers. They have generally been poorly served by conventional research
                    libraries, which have often discarded covers and advertising in the desire to
                    conserve space and whose catalogues seldom represent the actual nature of their
                    holdings.</p>
                <p>The digital remediation of periodicals has also been complex. Digitization is a
                    complex term with a variety of meanings and consequently a variety of products,
                    each with different stakeholders. Librarians want simple formats that can be
                    produced, catalogued, stored, and delivered in standard ways. Scholars of visual
                    arts want pages images of very high resolution and chromatic fidelity; many
                    linguists and textual scholars don't care about pages at all but are keenly
                    invested in machine-readable transcriptions of complete texts that are often
                    spread across different pages and different issues. Scholars of print need
                    information about paper types and typography. Repositories need information
                    about copyright.</p>
                <p>Although most text-based scholars (literature, history, sociology, cultural
                    studies) seldom venture beyond the downloaded PDF and token search, some have
                    begun to engage digital textuality in more complex and sophisticated ways, and
                    these engagements have exposed some of the limitations of standard approaches to
                    digitization, which often focus on graphical user interfaces to page images and
                    the production of efficient inverted indexes at the expense of the periodical
                    corpus.</p>
                <p>This panel follows a session at the 2014 Digital Humanities Conference in
                    Lausanne, Switzerland, entitled "Remediating 20th-Century Magazines of the Arts:
                    Approaches, Methods, Possibilities," which stimulated an ongoing series of
                    discussions and calls for the formation of an ADHO SIG devoted to Periodicals.

                    to go beyond the retrieval paradigm to explore other methods and approaches to

                    many ways digital technologies enable them today. </p>

                <head>„Horizontal“ reading in a corpus of 19th century German music magazines and
                    daily newspapers: analysing the debates on Verdi’s <hi rend="italic">Messa da
                        Requiem</hi>
                </head>
                <p>Perhaps even more than today, musical concerts in the 19th century were most
                    relevant social and cultural events. Whenever a new musical piece was performed,
                    detailed reviews were published in local newspapers, discussing musical ideas as
                    well as the quality of composition and performance. The discussions were usually
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">feuilleton</hi> and in many cases even on the
                    title page. Music critique was part of a general cultural discourse, connected
                    to political opinions, religious beliefs and social imprints, and newspapers
                    were a relevant forum for these debates. </p>
                <p>In the late 1860s, the number of German newspapers increased immensely, due to
                    less restrictive press laws and to advanced printing techniques as well. It was
                    in the mid-1870s when the newspapers announced a new piece by the Italian opera
                    composer Giuseppe Verdi: The grand <hi rend="italic">Messa da Requiem</hi>, a
                    commemorative work for orchestra, choir and soloists, for the deceased Italian
                    writer Alessandro Manzoni. The first performances in Austria and Germany induced
                    a discussion about the (in)appropriateness of operatic style in the genre of
                    sacred music, and if church music should ideally be free of realism and
                    overwhelming or untrue emotion. </p>
                <p>The research described here focuses on analyzing the ideals of requiem music from
                    the perspective of German music critique and compares them on regional and local
                    levels. The analysis was supported by TEI-encoded transcriptions of all relevant
                    German articles between 1874 and 1878, resulting in a corpus of 330 texts and
                    approximately one million characters. The markup focuses on semantics: About
                    8,000 entities and relations, amongst them more than 500 individual persons, 140
                    performances, 100 geographic items and 135 musical works, and 100 cases of text
                    reuse were identified.</p>
                <p>The corpus was then analyzed from different perspectives. Based on the semantic
                    markup, each partial analysis started from one single entry point (e.g. <hi
                        rend="italic">Kyrie</hi>, the first part of Verdi’s composition), extracts
                    all occurrences of one semantic unit, including some context, and compares all
                    these in respect to publication journal, place and date and possibly author’s
                    background. A delicate matter is the extent of context, which operates
                    sufficiently on phrase segments in most cases. This method of extracting and
                    parallel reading the contexts of one single semantic unit, or metaphorically:
                    »horizontal« reading, helps identifying patterns in the reception. For example,
                    the part <hi rend="italic">Agnus Dei,</hi> a very popular piece which was
                    mentioned in more than 60 texts, was strikingly often compared with other known
                    opera numbers for its tune, which suggested that Verdi could have copied the
                    melody. While musicological research has so far been limited to individual
                    critics, the new method can be used to compare different receptions to each
                    other without requiring background information on the single authors, which is
                    often not available. However, this method requires accessible digital copies of
                    newspapers, reliable metadata, high quality OCR or transcriptions, phrase
                    segmentation, and tagged semantic entities. </p>

                <head>Re-discovering the „hidden women“ of 19th century Egyptology through thematic
                    analysis of historical newspapers</head>
                <p>The end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries saw great archaeological
                    activity in Egypt, a period that came to be known as the “Golden Age” of
                    Egyptology. My research seeks to re-examine the ambiguous and liminal position
                    of women attached to these archaeological digs and expeditions. The starting
                    point was the unpublished travel journals of Mrs. Emma B. Andrews, who for over
                    two decades between 1889 and 1914 traveled the Nile with the millionaire lawyer
                    turned archaeologist, Theodore M. Davis. Andrews was present when Davis
                    discovered eighteen of the forty-two tombs now known in the Valley of the Kings.
                    and her writings provide a detailed record of excavation often lacking in
                    contemporary publications.</p>
                <p>My initial work included transcribing and encoding the diaries in TEI XML,
                    tagging named entities that have formed the basis of a research database and a
                    digital edition. The research corpus has expanded to include material written by
                    the wives, relatives, and friends of expedition directors, archaeologists,
                    artists, and photographers working in Egypt at that time, and comprises diaries,
                    correspondence, historical ephemera and a large number of historical newspapers.
                    These documents give the historian an overview of the social, geographical and
                    political history of Egypt at the time within the broader context of the
                    histories of archaeology and Egyptology, of gender studies, and of the social,
                    cultural and political history of the Victorian era.</p>
                <p>Working with a large corpus of digitized newspapers has shifted the work away
                    from granular markup towards broader thematic analysis, including topic modeling
                    and ngram analysis. This paper focuses on the process and challenges of
                    extracting significant information from collections of digitized newspapers of
                    varying quality and content using computational methods, using material drawn
                    from archives including Chronicling America, Gale Primary Sources, Europeana
                    Newspapers, and the British Library.</p>
                <p>Relevant newspaper articles, advertisements, and editorials have been compiled
                    from keyword searches, based on lists generated from the named entities captured
                    during the markup of diaries and correspondence. This has been a simple yet
                    effective way to create relevant datasets - a task that would otherwise have
                    been slow and unwieldy given the scope of the source material.</p>
                <p>The main challenge has been poor-quality OCR, which has affected returned search
                    results. This has led to the development of strategies for cleaning bad OCR
                    programmatically using NLTK and RegEx, as well as with digital tools developed
                    for the purpose, including Lexos and Gale’s Digital Scholar Lab.</p>
                <p>Work beyond text cleaning has focused on analyzing curated newspaper datasets in
                    an effort to identify prevalent cultural and historical themes using topic
                    modeling tools and ngram analysis. The aim is to explore Egyptological women’s
                    writing within this cultural context, to develop a picture of everyday life from
                    multiple historical primary source material, a topic that is often obscured from
                    an historian’s view.</p>

                <head>The periodical as a geographical space: the 19th century Hebrew <hi
                        rend="italic">HaZefirah</hi> as a case study </head>
                <p>A historical periodical, just like any historical event or phenomenon, is defined
                    in space and time. Its institutions operate from actual buildings; it is
                    circulated via transportation routes; and through its reader network it connects
                    between places and people. However, the relation between the two concepts,
                    “geographical space” and “periodical,” is not one-way. Just as much as the
                    periodical is within a geographical space, one can and should explore the ways
                    in which geographical spaces are within periodicals, and most importantly, are
                    created by them. Many periodicals produce an internal geographical space, whose
                    attributes and connections result from the text and inner conventions of the
                    periodical, which might include the distinction between different pages,
                    articles, and sections, or the distinction between places that appear in the
                    headlines and places that appear in the body of the text. Geographical places,
                    such as cities, mountains, rivers, states and continents, are located on paper
                    rather than on the globe; their sizes (or altitudes) are defined by the
                    frequency of their references, and the distances between the places are defined
                    by proximity on the line, page or article. These geographical spaces that emerge
                    from the text are mediated geographical spaces with completely different shapes
                    and topographies than the “normal” world map. They are influenced by cultural,
                    political, ideological and economic perceptions of writers and readers of the
                    periodical, but they also reinforce such perceptions and legitimize them. Recent
                    advances in digitization, automatic annotation, morphological and lexical
                    analysis, as well as geographic and network mapping, have made the exploration
                    of such uncharted and chaotic spaces more feasible than before. This paper will
                    use the nineteenth century Hebrew newspaper <hi rend="italic">HaZefira</hi> as a
                    case study for different geographical spaces that originate from and within the
                    newspaper. By alternating between various ways of representing the geographical
                    data in the journalistic text, I will show that spaces are constantly being
                    deterritorialized and reterritorialized. <hi rend="italic">Hazefira</hi>, which
                    operated between 1862 and 1931 was established in order to educate its readers
                    with worldly knowledge. Its articles discussed global news, travel stories, and
                    scientific discoveries, all of which involved spatial references. This paper
                    will discuss the different ways of exploring the relations between textual
                    spaces (within the journal) and their spatial references, the digital
                    methodologies that assist the unveiling of these spaces, and the problems that
                    are still left to be dealt with. </p>

                <head>Reconceptualizing resources: transforming Blue Mountain into TEI-encoded
                    editions and a bibliographic knowledge base</head>
                <p>This paper presents work being done by the Blue Mountain Project to create
                    TEI-based editions of its magazines and a bibliographic knowledge base of
                    avant-garde publication that leverages its detailed bibliographic metadata and
                    the resources of the semantic web.</p>
                <p>The Blue Mountain corpus of European and North American Avant-Garde periodicals
                    currently contains full runs of thirty-four titles in eleven languages, with
                    full text encoded in METS/ALTO and descriptive metadata in MODS. Blue Mountain's
                    rich and extensive metadata are not well represented in the content models
                    predominant in digital library repositories, models based on page images of
                    books and manuscripts. Furthermore, traditional bibliographic metadata often
                    fails to capture important information about periodicals, including periodicity,
                    issuance, and republication.</p>
                <p>The paper describes the reconception of Blue Mountain's digital objects from
                    library resources to digital editions, and of its metadata from descriptive
                    catalog records to a bibliographic knowledge base. It describes our
                    transformation of METS/ALTO documents into TEI-encoded XML and IIIF manifests,
                    as well as our conversion of Blue Mountain's MODS data to PRESSoo, part of a
                    family of models that enable analysts to capture the temporal nature of
                    publication as well as the inter-relationships among a variety of agents and
                    entities, allowing researchers to ask questions not easily answered before.</p>

                <head>A generous design of interfaces as an answer to the complexity of digitized
                    newspaper collections</head>
                <p>The digitization of historical sources does not automatically translate into
                    accessibility for historical research. The publication of digitized newspapers
                    and periodicals still leaves researchers willing to use them, hamstrung by
                    interfaces that offer little interaction other than search functionalities. The
                    insufficient interactions offered by current interfaces derive from their
                    technical and material background but also from the limited information
                    collected so far on the actual needs of the users, especially for research.
                    Research in the humanities is characterized by iteration, discovery and
                    exploration, especially given the huge volume and inherent complexity of
                    historical newspapers. Digitized newspapers offer opportunities for enrichment
                    which in turn should allow the development of novel research workflows which go
                    beyond mere content retrieval by means of keyword searches and get us closer to
                    humanist research practices.</p>
                <p>The ambition to offer room for more flexible and open interaction with digitized
                    cultural heritage collections has been captured by Whitelaw (DHQ, 2015) under
                    his call for more “generous interfaces”. The interdisciplinary project “impresso
                    - Media Monitoring of the Past” aims at materializing this call with the
                    development of a methodologically reflected technological framework to enable
                    new ways of engaging with multilingual digitized historical newspapers, mainly
                    from Switzerland and Luxembourg. In other words, impresso works on the
                    conception of a generous interface by fostering synergies between computational
                    linguists, designers, humanist researchers and institutions holding the
                    collections. Our proposition for the implementation of generosity is to enable
                    users to interact with primary sources in a digital environment using all
                    possible entry points resulting from this transformation. In our case, such
                    interactions are made possible by OCR improvement, annotations of named
                    entities, topics and text reuse detection as well as close and persistent
                    cooperation with historians and designers.</p>
                <p>We make use of newspaper metadata provided by the partnering libraries (who
                    printed it, when, where), the metadata produced during the compilation of
                    digital collections e.g. the quantity of words, pages, issues, as well as
                    annotations such as the segmentation of the document, named entities, topic
                    modeling and text reuse. We integrate indicators of the quality of the
                    digitization, e.g. OCR quality, missing issues, pages. Each of these items opens
                    a distinct entry for search, exploration and analysis.</p>
                <p>These added layers of information require a suitable interface to be usable for
                    researchers. This interface can facilitate the navigation of large-scale
                    collections, both to get an overview of the general collection made available
                    but also to get an overview of the content of a particular query or a particular
                    collection of articles, curated by a user. The impresso interface provides space
                    for a visual exploration of the collections, using filters to customize the
                    visualization based on the mentioned metadata, as well as automatically
                    extracted named entities, topics and text similarities. This push towards the
                    design of a “generous” interface should encourage novel research workflows and a
                    more reflective use of historical newspapers.</p>

                <head>Opportunities and limitations of research on historical periodicals in the era
                    of digitization: usability of digital collections in the light of different
                    modes of reception</head>
                <p>This paper reflects the initial discussions of the newspaper and magazine working
                    group in the Digital Humanities in the German-Speaking World Association ( <ref
                        target="https://dig-hum.de/ag-zeitungen-zeitschriften"
                        >https://dig-hum.de/ag-zeitungen-zeitschriften</ref> ). </p>
                <p>Before the new opportunities of digitization emerged in libraries all over the
                    world, historical periodicals were a rare and difficult field for both
                    researchers and librarians. In cultural and media history, only few titles were
                    in focus of research. In literary studies, periodicals were only consulted for
                    first editions by canonical authors. In economics, media studies and social
                    sciences, historical periodicals were observed for reader and consumer behavior.
                    For linguistics, historical periodicals showed changes in non-fictional language
                    though building up a corpus was very difficult before digitization (Burr
                    1997).</p>
                <p>Today, we can observe two ways of dealing with mass digitization. For libraries,
                    there is always the question of emphasizing the quantity or the quality of
                    digital editions. Both strategies have advantages: emphasizing quantity yields
                    access to a wider range of titles; emphasizing quality leads to better access,
                    better searchability, and greater re-usability.</p>
                <p>Likewise, researchers take advantage of the opportunities offered by digitization
                    in two ways. Those simply looking to read content in hard-to-find titles are
                    happy with the quantitative approach: a badly scanned page image is sufficient
                    for their needs. Researchers in a DH context, however, whose research entails
                    establishing author networks, layout analysis, or topic modeling, are frustrated
                    by the quantitative approach and dependent upon it at the same time. Still other
                    researchers are hampered by the loss of materiality inherent in digital
                    editions.</p>
                <p>It is time to open up a discussion about how the different players in the process
                    of digitization could work together to overcome these obstructions. We need to
                    establish and compare the requirements of the different stakeholders as well as
                    the status of the current landscape of digitized historical periodicals. At the
                    moment there is a very active movement in research on historical periodicals and
                    some are already considering digital collections as a knowledge systems and not
                    only as containers of text, images, and other pieces of information.</p>
