        <body>
            <p>The field of African language technology (De Pauw et al. 2011; Ndinga-Koumba-Binza
                and Bosch 2012; Amadou Dia 2014) has seen a rapid development in recent years, and
                several digital humanities projects and hubs have been established across the
                continent. Language documentation projects have focused on several endangered and
                minority languages, producing large digital corpora and data sets for African
                under-described languages. What is the place of African languages in the African
                digital landscape and what is the state-of-the-art of African digital scholarship?
                What are the challenges and the solutions for a DH approach in the field of African
                languages and linguistics? What are the good practices for building African-based
                repositories, language infrastructures and other digital capabilities? What is a
                sustainable model for the engagement of wider audiences and for digital capacity
                building in Africa? How can we address ethical issues and the “tension” between the
                trend towards open access and the need to protect privacy and property rights of
                community speakers and researchers?</p>
            <p>The panel brings together scholars from different backgrounds (computational
                linguistics, natural language processing, language documentation and description) to
                answer these and other related questions and to share the experiences of scholars
                who are directly involved in DH research in Africa and in the management of
                African-based digital archives, repositories and infrastructures. In this way we
                hope to have a first bird’s eye-view of DH research for African languages, which
                will allow a critical discussion of the nature and future of the field.</p>

            <p>Reframing community building and civic engagement in L2 public sphere: A study of new
                media multilingualism in Nigeria democracy.</p>
            <p>One striking effect of the ongoing digital revolution is the evolving reconfiguration
                of the public sphere in most socio-political jurisdictions. From Europe to the
                Americas, and from Asia to Africa, social media is revolutionizing communications
                and social networking activities, redefining the mechanics of our daily interactions
                in private and public spaces. </p>
            <p>In the last one decade and more, reforms in most Telecommunication sectors and
                increase in internet penetration have positively impacted communication practices in
                Africa. In some of these democratic contexts, the phenomenal growth in
                computer-mediated communication has made the practice of democracy more
                participatory; creating a more virile public sphere. Citizens’ online activities
                have expanded due to rapid growth in internet penetration and the proliferation of
                social media platforms now accessible through various handheld devices, laptops, and
                more recently affordable smartphones. </p>
            <p>This present study addresses gaps in online multilingual political discourse studies
                in Africa, using Nigeria as a case study. First, it examines the use of social media
                within the Nigerian socio-political context. Second, it discusses the extent to
                which social media platforms have provided tools and possibilities for participatory
                and inclusive democratic process. </p>
            <p>Pivotally, the study focuses on how the emergence of new media multilingual mechanism
                reshapes online political conversation and social engagement in Nigeria. It studies
                how the use of English and some local languages (Yoruba, Igbo, Pidgin) in online
                posts help to facilitate community building, social mobilization, social networking,
                and foster civic engagement. Also, it discusses how these new technologies
                absorb/adopt some offline linguistic behaviour to inspire online social networking
                and participation in public conversation on current and topical political
                issues.</p>
            <p>The data was drawn from the repository of the Corpus of Nigeria New media Discourse
                in English (CONNMDE), an ongoing Digital Humanities project at the University of
                Lagos. In eliciting the data deposited in the corpus, we utilized web-based corpus
                tools and applications to harvest relevant posts and chats from the websites,
                Twitter handles and Facebook pages of key political parties and political actors in
                Nigeria between July 2014 and October 2018 (the first phase of the project).
                Additional data was elicited from the online portals of three major national
                newspapers in Nigeria (Punch, Vanguard and the Nation).</p>
            <p>Relying on theoretical insights from Computer Mediated Discourse Analysis (CMDA) and
                Speech Accommodation Theory (SAT), the study considers language choices mediated by
                new technologies as strong motivation for innovative discourse strategies being
                deployed in this context. </p>
            <p>Among others, some of our findings suggest that new media platforms now accommodate
                and instantiate some offline <hi rend="italic">socio</hi>-linguistic behaviour found
                in second language English-speaking contexts in Africa. For instance, some features
                of Speech Accommodation strategies (e.g. Giles &amp; Powesland, 1975) common in
                African socio-cultural contexts, and online socio-pragmatic discourse cues, now
                constitute a key component of communication strategies adopted in building online
                community and promoting civic engagement within the public sphere. </p>

                <hi style="font-size:12pt">The dominant trends in present day Linguistics in Africa
                    are both theoretical and applied. Theoretical research is geared towards either
                    eliciting structural features of envisaged linguistic systems or the testing of
                    grammatical theories which require little or no data for their
                    operationalization. Applied linguistics is mostly concerned with language
                    teaching and resorts to naturalistic language data only for the sake of
                    illustration. Running contrary to this trend, Digital scholarship and language
                    archiving operate on infrastructures that provide a integrated, data-conducive
                    environment for the assembly, organization, processing and publication of
                    research. As it is, therefore, current practices in Linguistics in Africa do not
                    seem to be in vital need of Digital Archives. This presentation does not focus
                    as such on the structural discrepancy between language archives and the
                    discipline of linguistics in Africa. Instead I will attempt to interrogate the
                    relevance of a century of academic endeavor (i.e. in the discipline of
                    linguistics) with regard to the complexity of its object, namely Africa’s
                    extensive multilingualism. One crucial question which needs to be asked, at this
                    juncture, is to know the ultimate end of current linguistic research. What do
                    linguists in Africa aim at when they set out to analyse aspects of the
                    linguistic reality? What is the significance of the information that each
                    piecemeal research produces? Are linguists in Africa working together towards
                    achieving common goals or, has the discipline of linguistics become a routine in
                    the academia which serves as justification for the continuity of an
                    institutional business? Answers to the above questions may neither be obvious
                    nor straightforward. However, most stake-holders will admit that our discipline,
                    in Africa, does not pursue coherent objectives from one university to another.
                    It could have been hoped that the spur of language documentation into Africa's
                    linguistics over the past fifteen years and the lobby thereto of funding bodies
                    such as DOBES and ELDP could have regenerated the linguistics scholarship in the
                    continent. The increasing amount of data which has been harnessed from
                    documentary projects and which are accessible via well-established and archives
                    such as LAT (MPI-Nijmegen) and ELAR do not seem to have substantially impacted
                    the scientific agenda of the discipline of linguistics in Africa so far. I will
                    content in this presentation that, embracing digital archives and digital
                    scholarship in the discipline of linguistics in Africa is tantamount to shifting
                    from the current ad hoc, individualistic research paradigm, to communal
                    scholarship. This entails definition of common research objectives and
                    methodologies, from data collection and organization to data dissemination. This
                    also entails mutualization of the scientific information and cross-verification
                    of structural analyses from one named language data set to another, which would
                    aim at pursuing a general understanding of the underlying experiences which
                    justify the fact that, under apparent linguistic variation, there seems to be an
                    abstract cultural reality which no individual grammar of a named language could
                    help to uncover.</hi>

            <p>Intelligent Humanities: Towards High Performance Applications for African
                Languages</p>
            <p>Today’s society is witnessing the production of extreme large data sets (Bag Data)
                that has challenged traditional processing and storage methods. This sudden state of
                data explosion has indeed introduced major changes into existing data management
                processes, demanding a robust and sustainable solution, to efficiently process,
                analyze, store, share, and disseminate data into the future.</p>
            <p>From experience, the processing mechanism can be structured following the standard
                data mining pipeline (digitization -&gt; transcription -&gt; pattern recognition
                -&gt; simulation and inference -&gt; preservation -&gt; curation), and the degree of
                difficulty scales with the complexity and volume of data. Hence, massive digital
                objects in the humanities (e.g., large-scale corpus, images, unprocessed artifacts,
                audio, and videos) require suitable methods to guarantee useful extractions, for
                meaningful interpretations. In this contribution, we examine the role computer
                algorithms play in mining, shaping and representing data in the humanities. We
                propose an intelligent framework that maintains consistent applications that go
                beyond traditional methodologies, to reveal inherent patterns, trends, associations,
                and especially relates to human behavior and interaction – the Big Data experience. </p>
            <p>Linking the past and the future constitute our Digital Humanities efforts in the
                University of Uyo, Nigeria – a product of an interdisciplinary cooperation between
                the Computer Science and Linguistics and Nigerian Languages departments. The first
                stage of the proposed framework is predicated on cross-domain metadata, and metadata
                mapping – which pose the problem of connecting existing metadata to embedded links.
                The key challenge however, is the metadata mapping – as heterogeneity of inputs
                complicates one-to-one mapping, and harmonization of the metadata and ontologies
                appear intractable. As such, experience and best practices are mandatory when
                transforming and consolidating formats into internal knowledge representation, for
                clustering and reasoning. Learning from existing data constitutes the second phase
                of our framework that drives the intelligence (imposes cluster patterns, and
                reasoning), required to enhance the classification process – for accurate prediction
                and visualization of the data sets. This at the end maximizes the use of the digital
                resources. Further, dissemination of the resources can be achieved through a Web
                Management Interface (WMI), after proper ethical and copyright procedure has been
                followed.</p>
            <p> An implementation of the proposed framework to salvage a critically endangered
                language, ‘Medefaidrin’ is demonstrated in this paper. A multilingual application
                that embeds intelligent techniques for the analysis and visualization of prosodic
                features of selected West African languages: Medefaidrin (Artificial, Nigeria),
                Ibibio (New Benue Congo, Nigeria), Igbo (Benue Congo, Nigeria), Yoruba (Niger Congo,
                Nigeria), and Hausa (Afro-Asiatic, Nigeria), is developed. The speech corpus adopted
                is the Ibadan 400 words – a list of basic (English) lexical items of any language,
                translated and recorded in the various languages. The developed application is
                Web-based and enables useful pattern discovery that reveals the dynamic nature of
                these languages, as well as aid the pronunciation and simulation of sentences – a
                necessary Computer Aided Learning (CAL) tool.</p>

            <p>Setting up a RI is only part of the process. The end goal is to ensure that the wider
                research community is able to not only access resources and tools but enabled to
                critically apply new skills to address the challenges of tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Ethical issues in digital data collection and exploration</p>
            <p>All forms of research in the language sciences critically depend on data collection
                from language users. Increasingly and universally data collection methods and
                processing are digital. Moreover, there is the growing realisation that to
                understand language practices we cannot ignore the visual mode of language. This can
                only be captured through digital video. Furthermore, researchers are increasingly
                under pressure to make their data openly accessible. However, such digital data
                carries representative of data providers. How can we ethically go about these? In
                this talk, I will raise the ethical challenges involved in collecting, processing,
                curating, storing and exploring different forms of data. How can we carry out these
                activities paying attention to the principles of justice, and of
                beneficence/maleficence, i.e. practices should not be harmful to research
                participants</p>
