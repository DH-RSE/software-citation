            <p style="text-align:left; ">Literature and history, writ large, are fields with
                prominent voices in the digital humanities community. Art history, film studies,
                archaeology, and anthropology form recognizable disciplinary clusters within the
                international discourse of digital humanities as well. Since the mid-20th century,
                “area studies” have offered their own interdisciplinary organizing principle for
                drawing together scholars who work with a variety of materials and approaches. While
                on one hand, this arrangement would appear to be naturally conducive to
                international collaboration, geopolitical tensions and restrictions have at times
                formed a barrier between area studies scholars in the United States, and their
                colleagues working in and around the “areas” in question. This has been especially
                true in the field of Slavic and East European studies, which have been knit together
                in the United States through two major professional organizations that have --
                through a combination of circumstance, necessity, and then habit -- cultivated a
                distinct and somewhat insular scholarly community in Slavic studies.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">The fall of the Iron Curtain, the fluctuations in the
                perceived threat of Russia to the United States, and the spread of the Internet as a
                medium for communication have provided scholars worldwide with opportunities to
                engage with Slavic area studies through a global and collaborative lens in ways that
                were not conceivable earlier in the history of the field. While many U.S. scholars
                have taken advantage of the possibility to travel to Slavic and East European
                countries, the scholarly networks of citation and discourse remain centered within
                the communities formed by the U.S.-based professional organizations.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">The emergence of digital humanities tools and methodologies
                has provided an opportunity for rethinking the collaborative landscape for Slavic
                and East European studies. Much as in the humanities as a whole, the percentage of
                scholars in the field actively using digital tools and methodologies is fairly
                small. For Slavic and East European studies, however, any effort to develop a
                community around digital humanities is compounded by the comparatively small overall
                size of the field. Indeed, while there have been efforts to run a digital humanities
                interest group through one of the major professional organizations, the work of
                sustaining the group has fallen on one or two people, as there is not enough of a
                critical mass to spread around the necessary but time-consuming work of cultivating
                and growing the group. Rather than working within existing scholarly organizational
                frameworks, some U.S.-based scholars have turned towards international collaboration
                to further their engagement with digital tools and methodologies. This panel brings
                together Slavists and East Europeanists from the United States, Western Europe, and
                Russia whose research, teaching, and infrastructure development is shaped by
                engagement with colleagues who share similar materials and methods despite widely
                varying national and institutional contexts. In addition to presenting highlights of
                their own work, panel participants will reflect on the ways in which digital
                humanities provides a different organizing principle for their scholarly networks
                and community. </p>

            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">Due to the constantly increasing number of digitally
                available sources, those working in the fields of History and Cultural Studies are
                faced with a significant challenge, namely, to develop new practices and procedures
                around the verification of sources and the provision of digital material. Of central
                importance here are questions relating to the provenance, validity, and critical
                analysis of sources. These matters are particularly pertinent in the case of East
                Europe, where transnational conflicts around shared historical and cultural heritage
                have given rise to a special need for research-based information, digital source
                criticism, and questions of research ethics.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">As a leading European research institute on the history of
                Eastern Europe, we continue to develop our shared research infrastructure in
                collaboration with other partners, and we need to keep these goals in mind. This
                presentation aims at addressing the challenges and opportunities of building up a
                multi-national infrastructure for a digital and critical documentation of cultural
                heritage in Eastern Europe. This process involves not only developing research
                software and a standardized vocabulary, but also mapping out multi-perspective
                approaches relating to the exegesis of digital sources within metadata structures
                and, last but not least, providing dialogue-based formats for reflecting on
                historical sources in the digital age.</p>

            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">DHlab, the international digital humanities lab launched in
                at our technical university in St. Petersburg (Russia) in October 2018, is dedicated
                to exploring how technology facilitates new possibilities in understanding society
                and global culture. This is a collaboration between our institution and a private
                university in the United States, and intends to draw in partners from DH communities
                all over the world. In this presentation, we will discuss our priorities when
                starting a humanities-focused initiative at a technical university. These include 1)
                the importance of humanistic disciplines in the discourse of Information
                Technologies, Computer Science and Engineering; 2) motivating women in science; 3)
                applying STEM methods to Arts and Humanities research problems; 4) managing
                different approaches while working on digital humanities projects; 5) involving
                students of different majors and interests in interdisciplinary projects; and 6)
                highlighting digital humanities among wide audience using social networks. We will
                share our experience in training the next generation of DH scholars, developing
                innovative DH projects, contributing to creating useful software, providing women
                within Humanities and STEM with equal opportunities to conduct interdisciplinary
                research etc.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">We will also discuss one of our most significant projects,
                a web application that maps historical and cultural heritage data about key
                landmarks of St. Petersburg, Russia. With input from scholars of history, library
                science, cultural studies and information technologies, the project team has
                conducted semantic analysis on a large, multilingual textual corpus that includes
                memoirs, documentaries and periodicals, and uses Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) to
                encode information about people, relationships, and events, and Uniform Resource
                Identifiers (URIs) to identify locations. All landmarks are being mapped onto an
                interactive city map of St. Petersburg with a user-friendly interface to facilitate
                easy navigation and filtering.</p>

                    Field from the Cold War to the Present</hi>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">This presentation uses DH tools to turn a lens to the
                Slavic Studies professional community. In 2018, the Association for Slavic, East
                European and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES) the main North American-based international
                academic professional organization in the field, celebrates its 70 th anniversary.
                As part of the anniversary, the association published the programs for thirty-four
                of its conventions. These programs are a valuable guide not only to individual
                contributions but to the institutional networks embedded in the Slavic Studies
                field. This paper uses network analysis to analyze the shifting intellectual
                motivations and professional ties in Slavic Studies.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">Before the fall of the USSR, Slavic Studies was not only an
                academic field but a front in the Cold War. US government funding motivated by fear
                of communism also produced works in the humanities with no immediate political value
                and created a new field of area studies (Engerman 2009). Network analysis can assess
                Engerman’s qualitative research and go beyond it. After the Cold War ended, Slavic
                Studies undertook a “post-mortem” of the USSR. How did the constellation of
                intellectual and professional networks shift? After the financial crisis of 2007-08
                that brought cuts in research spending, how did Slavic Studies change? What
                institutions remained in the field and with what institutional concerns? Similarly,
                network analysis can help understand early academic reactions to Russia’s more
                aggressive stance in the world since 2011.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">This study can also contribute to understanding how digital
                humanities is growing in fields outside of Western Europe and North America. By
                isolating the networks in panels whose papers use relevant keywords (e.g.,
                “digital,” “dh,” “computational”) the paper will ask how the impact of digital
                humanities has and has not impacted the Slavic field.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">
                <hi rend="italic">International DH Collaboration as Pedagogy</hi>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">Pedagogy has long been a major topic of interest in the DH
                community. An opportunity for engaging students in DH that has not been addressed is
                through involvement in international partnerships. In this presentation, we discuss
                our institution’s emerging Slavic DH Working Group, our decision to prioritize
                collaboration with international partners, and our efforts to include both graduate
                and undergraduate students in our work. As an alternative - or supplement - to the
                curricular or project-based learning models that are most common in many DH
                programs, involvement in international partnerships provides not only skills,
                competencies and exposure to professional practice, but opportunities for
                cross-cultural knowledge exchange that are key for the advancement of both
                field-specific and DH scholarship.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">The Slavic DH Working Group at our research university is
                the only one of its kind in the United States. Established in 2017 through the joint
                effort of faculty, graduate students, librarians and DH staff, the Slavic DH Working
                Group is a community of scholars at all levels, from various disciplines, and
                engaged in a variety of professional fields. Promoting the exploration of digital
                humanities in Slavic, East European and Eurasian Studies, the group meets monthly
                during the academic year for events, trainings, and mentorship . In this
                presentation, we will discuss our collaboration with a research institute in Germany
                whose focus is Eastern European history. In the summer of 2018, we took eight
                members of the Slavic DH Working Group - including two graduate students and two
                undergraduates - to Germany for a 5-day DH workshop called “Digital Mapping Eastern
                Europe.” Besides our US group, the workshop brought in early-career scholars from
                Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Israel. We
                will discuss how the format of the workshop allowed the graduate students to make
                significant strides in their dissertation work. The workshop was a unique
                opportunity for what Geoffrey Rockwell and Stefan Sinclair call “acculturation”
                (Rockwell and Sinclair, 2012) - not just academic professionalization, but broader
                exposure to the culture of a field that includes different types of jobs, and in
                various national and international contexts. We will also discuss the opportunities
                this experience afforded the undergraduate participants, and the kind of both
                collaborative and independent work that the workshop generated. By contrast to the
                more conventional contexts in which undergraduates learn DH - either in the
                classroom setting or as paid laborers on faculty-led DH projects - participation in
                the international exchange allowed students to become involved in the community as
                scholars in their own right.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">We will suggest that international collaborations in DH are
                particularly beneficial for smaller fields like Slavic where use of digital methods
                are relatively new, and where formal and fruitful international exchange by groups
                of scholars can difficult to sustain. Bringing DH into the graduate and
                undergraduate Slavic Studies experience exposes students to new scholarly approaches
                while animating Russian and East European cultural heritage and collections for
                young scholars.</p>

                <hi rend="italic">Conversational Versus Co-occurrence Models in Networking the
                    Russian Novel</hi>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">The Russian novel has been traditionally regarded as the
                novel of ideas, in which the conflicting views on the national identity and Russia’s
                relationship with the “other” are presented in the dramatized narrative. Especially
                after Mikhail Bakhitn’s pioneering ideas of dialogism and polyphony of Fyodor
                Dostoevsky’s novels, it became common to view the novel as a balanced dramatization
                of conflicts among polar opposites. In my ongoing research project on the network
                novel in the late imperial Russian culture, I approach Tolstoy’s and Dostoevsky’s
                novels as models of an emerging liberal society. These narratives are not merely
                depictions of individual experiences manifested in text, but also represent complex
                societies whose imaginary social forms can be quantified and analyzed.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">In British and American nineteenth-century novels, a shift
                occurred between the novel of domesticity and the network novel which exaggerated
                contrast within texts to expose the search for a resolution in the world outside.
                This study aims to examine a corpus of Russian novels to see whether they have the
                same clear dichotomy between a nuclear family type and a social panorama type.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">This study takes the approach of comparing the
                conversational and with co-occurrence methods for collecting data from the novels.
                The conversational method is based on the participation of the characters in a
                “speech act,” defined as a continuous span of narrative time featuring a set of
                characters co-located in space and time, where they take turns speaking, are
                mutually aware of each other, and each character’s speech is intended for the other
                to hear. The co-occurrence method uses the automatic extraction of interactions
                based on the appearance of two characters in one sentence or short paragraph. This
                study compares networks created in Gephi using each method and argues that the
                co-occurrence of the characters in one scene does not yield significantly different
                results compared to measuring associations via speech acts. The relative simplicity
                of identifying speech acts, versus identifying all instances of speaking and
                non-speaking characters’ co-location in space and time, makes an approach based on
                speech acts even more attractive.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">Examining the effectiveness of different methods for
                generating networks from novels has implications for technical developments that can
                further research in Russian literature. If speech act-based networks reliably
                capture the nodes and edges of the Russian realist novels, that presents an
                opportunity to develop algorithms that can identify speech acts with a reasonable
                degree of accuracy. This, in turn, has implications for corpus development, and
                ensuring that those corpora are formatted in machine-readable ways (e.g. encoded in
                UTF-8 and available as plain text files, rather than in proprietary formats). This
                talk will reflect on experiences, challenges, and successes in sharing corpora and
                tools with an international group of colleagues who use similar digital approaches
                in their research on Russian literature.</p>

                <hi rend="italic">Rethinking Scholarly Networks Through the Lens of Digital
                    Humanities</hi>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">Scholarly societies are core social and community
                infrastructure in the humanities. Presenting at conferences sponsored by these
                societies is a crucial component for gaining visibility in a field, and bolsters the
                legitimacy of one’s candidacy for jobs, awards, and other forms of recognition. In
                North America, these societies are typically scoped nationally, and attending a
                major annual conference for a society is an expensive endeavor — a situation only
                compounded for scholars who work interdisciplinarily. The professional necessity of
                directing significant amounts of one’s travel budget towards these conferences,
                combined with the limits of their national scope, impede international
                collaboration, particularly for early-career scholars.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">Digital humanities provides a different axis for finding
                and engaging with colleagues across national boundaries. Particularly for the
                text-centric scholarship commonly found in literature and history, building corpora
                is time-consuming and expensive endeavor. Once completed, such corpora can be a
                transformative resource for colleagues pursuing a wide range of research questions.
                For scholars whose work involves applying natural-language processing tools to
                languages other than modern English, there are resources like stopword lists, word
                embeddings, and pre- and post-processing scripts that can meaningfully be shared
                between projects.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">Collaborative development of tools, resources, taxonomies,
                and infrastructure that are directly related to Slavic studies is itself a
                significant step forward for the field -- but in the long run, perhaps the most
                significant impact of DH-centered collaboration is the “downstream effects” of the
                relationships established between scholars. Scholarly networks are valuable not only
                for research collaboration, but also as a source of advice when dealing with
                institutional challenges, and connections and opportunities for one’s students.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">This paper will draw together unifying themes from the
                presentations given by other panelists and consider the ways in which digital
                humanities could reshape the current insular, nationally-centered landscape of
                Slavic and East European area studies in the U.S., and foster the emergence of new
                international scholarly networks that have an impact beyond the field of Slavic
                studies itself. It will also reflect on the ways that existing disciplinary
                scholarly societies could take a more proactive role in breaking down the national
                boundaries that have emerged through their current structure, for instance, by fully
                engaging with digital tools and platforms with roots in the digital humanities /
                scholarly communications communities, such as Humanities Commons.</p>
