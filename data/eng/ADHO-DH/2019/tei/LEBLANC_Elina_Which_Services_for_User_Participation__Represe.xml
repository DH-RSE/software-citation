            <p>This poster will present the cooperative and collaborative services defined by a
                French-Italian Digital Library (DL) founded on the principles of public engagement
                    <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
                    <p rend="footnote text"> Public engagement is intended as “the myriad of ways in
                        which the activity and benefits of higher education and research can be
                        shared with the public. Engagement is by definition a two-way process,
                        involving interaction and listening, with the goal of generating mutual
                        benefit” (National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement, s. d.). </p>
                </note>. Cooperation and collaboration are often confused with each other, but our
                experience leads us to distinguish them in order to better achieve the purpose of
                our project. </p>
            <p>We define a DL based on the public engagement model as a <hi rend="bold"
                    >participative DL</hi>. Such a library offers a set of services that encourages
                expert and lay users to work together to enrich pre-existing content and disseminate
                their knowledge, all the while acquiring new skills. Public engagement within a DL
                can take different forms, defined by the ways users are encouraged to contribute.
                First, the public engagement can result in a <hi rend="bold">cooperative</hi>
                participation. Users perform a task that helps the DL to enrich its collection, but
                during the realization of this task the DL in return passes on knowledge to them, as
                is done with the citizen sciences, such as the <hi rend="italic">Old Weather</hi>
                project <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
                        <ref target="https://www.oldweather.org">https://www.oldweather.org</ref>
                    </p>
                </note>. </p>
            <p>According to a cooperative model, only the results are mutualized (Misanchuk et
                Anderson 2001; Choi et Pak 2006; Kozar 2010); the DL defines the way users can
                contribute, that is to say in a way that can potentially benefit both library and
                users: the DL gains new content and the users, new skills. </p>
            <p>If cooperation is often the way of public engagement that is encountered in DLs, a
                second model is the one of <hi rend="bold">collaboration</hi>. With this latter, the
                library and the users co-construct services and digital contents. It is the results
                    <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the working process that are mutualized and shared
                among the participants (Hord 1981; Misanchuk et Anderson 2001; Choi et Pak 2006;
                Kozar 2010) – as seen in the <hi rend="italic">The Social Edition of the Devonshire
                    Manuscript</hi>

                </note>. </p>
            <p>We have applied those principles to our DL, which aims at becoming a participative
                digital library, where the users are both readers and authors of the content they
                access. To define our participative services and to allow the coexistence of
                cooperation and collaboration within the same interface, we relied on an exhaustive
                state of the art of participative services in digital heritage projects and on the
                results of a user study (2016-2017). This user study took the form of a
                questionnaire (67 answers) and interviews (8 participants), centered on the
                behaviour of users on DLs, as well as on the notion of participation. The poster
                will focus on the collaborative and cooperative services we have chosen for <hi
                    rend="italic">Fonte Gaia</hi>, thanks to this user study and this state of the
                art. </p>
            <p>Our <hi rend="bold">collaborative</hi> services allow users to carry out digital
                projects focused on Italian studies, with the help of the DL managers: digital
                scholarly editions, edition of ebooks, creation of reading paths or digital
                exhibitions. The scholarly community behind our DL (Digital humanities scholars,
                philologists, librarians, computer scientists) supports users in the realization of
                their project, from the definition of common objectives and working methods to the
                publication on our DL. They work together at each stage of the project. </p>
            <p>These projects are carried out in the back-office of our DL, which is based on <rs
                    type="software">Omeka</rs> S <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">
                    <p rend="footnote text">
                        <ref target="https://omeka.org/s/">https://omeka.org/s/</ref>
                    </p>
                </note>. Some of these user-driven projects, such as virtual exhibitions, rely on
                standard tools (in the form of plugins). Others, such as digital editions, are
                currently developed using external tools, and simply linked to the DL. Collaboration
                thus leads to a diversification of user intervention spaces: users are not only
                associated with the front-end interface, but also with the back-end interface. </p>
            <p>At the same time, we have defined <hi rend="bold">cooperative</hi> services, for
                instance the adding of tags, of bibliographical references or of comments, all of
                which performed in a controlled way. This will allow users to share their knowledge
                with others, while being initiated to a specific librarian skill. For instance, in
                the case of participatory indexing, we want the user to add keywords from controlled
                vocabularies: on one hand, it will ensure a harmonization of the contributions; on
                the other hand, it will initiate users to librarians’ indexing methods and help them
                better understand the vocabularies used by librarians, in order to improve their
                further research on the DL. The contribution process of cooperative services is
                entirely defined by the DL: those services will therefore be only accessible to the
                users from the front-end interface. </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; ">The development of these services is ongoing and is itself
                based on a collaborative process. Most of the services are developed by our DL’s
                transdisciplinary team. Other services will benefit from a special treatment, such
                as the indexation, which will be the subject of a hackathon in March 2019. Through a
                hackathon, participants with varied professional backgrounds will experiment several
                solutions to design a cooperative service in line with the librarians’ missions, as
                well as with the principles of public engagement.</p>
