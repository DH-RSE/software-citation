The
3D Consortium
of the
TGIR Huma-Num
has been created based on the observation that there are many initiatives around 3D for the Digital Humanities without real coordination between them. The proliferation of initiatives makes the task difficult and only a consortium-type organization can bring together forces in order to define standardized solutions. The difficulty is increased by the fact that we are dealing with multiple domains, combining science and technology with the humanities. The aim of the consortium is to facilitate discussions by putting together a maximum of research groups that integrate the use of 3D digital data in their scientific practice, to develops tools for acquisition, visualization, interpretation and preservation of data for the Humanities. The consortium is therefore willing to develop synergies between national Humanities and 3D disciplines in order to: (i) share experiences; (ii) edit recommendations

in terms of methodology, standards and formats; (iv) identify the specific needs of Digital Humanities and link them to the rapid evolution of 3D technologies; (v) develop common tools and platforms; (vi) bring French experiences into international networks (Parthenos, Dariah, ARIADNE); (vii) disseminate all this information as widely as possible, among academics, industry and administrations.
