                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Books written by and marketed towards women have been analyzed mostly in the
                    context of popular culture ( Radway, 1987; Hollows, 2000; Modleski, 2008). In
                    literary criticism however, fictional work by women is regularly held up to such
                    ‘women’s novels’ to measure the quality (van Boven, 1992; Vogel, 2001; Groos,
                    2011). This connection made between female author gender and popular feminine
                    novels is likely based on bias, but it is not yet well-researched in
                    computational stylistics. In this paper we present a pilot study for examining
                    this potential bias, through the combination of a reader survey and text
                    analysis. </p>

                <p>Although computational stylistics is now quite common in analysis of fiction
                    (i.e. Semino and Short, 2004), ‘women’s’ genres are not researched often in
                    relation to literature. Jautze et al. (2013) focuses on differences between the
                    syntactic make-up of sentences in literary novels and so-called ‘chick lit’ (cf.
                    Ferriss and Young, 2013); Montoro (2012) performs computational-linguistic
                    analysis on chick lit as opposed to a BNC sampler corpus – but not to literary
                    fiction specifically. </p>

                <p>What is the relationship between books by women and ‘women’s books’ according to
                    readers? We examine this through results of the National Reader Survey (2013).
                    Respondents were supplied with a list of 401 recent Dutch-language novels
                    (translated and originally Dutch, published between 2007-2012) that were most
                    often loaned from libraries and bought from bookstores between 2009-2012 (Koolen
                    et al., in preparation). <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
                        <p rend="footnote text"> Note that the Riddle corpus’ novels show the
                            one-sidedness of the market: it consists of few genres, there are very
                            few novels by people of color, it contains mostly European and
                            North-American novels. </p>
                    </note>, <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
                        <p rend="footnote text"> The factor of translation will be taken into
                            account in further development of this pilot, for information on effects
                            within the larger project, see van Dalen-Oskam, 2016. </p>
                    </note> Respondents supplied ratings of literary quality on books they had read
                    (on a scale of 1-7) and were allowed to motivate one of their scores. </p>
                <p> Overall, works by female authors are judged to have lower literary quality
                    (M=3.92, SD=0.81) than those by male authors (M=4.73, SD=1.04); t(344)=-8.34, p
                    &lt; 0.01. This is partially caused by romantic novels, which are mainly written
                    by women (M=3.02, SD=0.60). <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
                        <p rend="footnote text"> To distinguish genres, we roughly base ourselves on
                            Dutch publishers’ assignments of genre, which is done through a uniform
                            classification system in the Netherlands. </p>
                    </note> More surprisingly, within general fiction female authors’ works scores’
                    (M=4.55, SD=0.84) are significantly lower than for male’s (M=5.53, SD=0.73);
                    t(120)=-7.60, p&lt;0.01. </p>
                <p>An analysis of the motivations shows that the concept of the ‘women’s book’
                    (‘vrouwenboek’) and similar gendered terms are used dozens of times to explain
                    what literary quality is <hi rend="bold">not</hi>; a male equivalent is
                    mentioned twice (‘men’s book’, ‘boy’s book’). Examples of novels referred to as
                    ‘women’s’ book’ are translations of <hi rend="italic">Eat, Pray, Love</hi> by
                    Gilbert (general fiction), <hi rend="italic">Remember Me?</hi> by Kinsella
                    (romantic fiction) and
                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">The Ice Princess </hi>by Låckberg
                    (suspense). Thus, works by female authors are equated with ‘women’s books’
                    regardless of the novel’s own genre. Perceived connections that respondents
                    provide are: bad story (about love), a simple style, no deeper layers, etc.. But
                    how much do ‘women’s books’ differ from novels that are perceived as literary?
                    And are they more strongly connected to other female-authored novels than to
                    male-authored ones? </p>

                <p>We perform two experiments as a first exploration. We compare present-day
                    romantic novels by female authors (R), predominantly chick lit, to general
                    fiction by women (GF) and general fiction by men (GM). We select the lowest
                    scoring novels in the romantic genre and the highest in the general fiction
                    genre (i.e. the most ‘literary’ ones according to our respondents), to find the
                    clearest contrast (cf. Table 1). We use only one novel per author, unless the
                    author uses a different pen name (Kinsella/Wickham). </p>

                    <head>Experiment 1: style</head>
                    <p>As we have shown, the style of ‘women’s books’ is seen as inferior. We use
                        stylometric analysis to explore this notion, adding Gilbert’s <hi
                            rend="italic">Eat, Pray, Love</hi> to this experiment (cf. Section 3); a
                        hybrid of general fiction and romance. Stylometric analysis is most often
                        used to perform authorship recognition, but has been successfully applied to
                        identify gender (Rybicki, 2015) and fictional genres (Allison et al., 2011).
                        We apply the method detailed in Eder (2017). First, with R-package <rs
                            type="software">Stylo</rs> (Eder et al., 2016), we construct a bootstrap
                        consensus tree based on the 100 through 1,000 most frequent words with
                        100-word intervals, using Classic Delta to calculate stylistic similarity
                        (cf. Eder, 2017). Second, we use network analysis and visualization tool <rs
                            type="software">Gephi</rs> to visualize the novels’ connectedness
                        (Bastian et al., 2009). Color-codes are based on modularity, which
                        visualizes groupings of greater inner coherence (Blondel et al., 2018).
                        Finally, we apply the ForceAtlas2 algorithm to make groupings more visually
                        distinct. </p>

                    <p>Fig. 1 shows six clusters. Part of the romantic novels (blue, soft pink) are
                        indeed separated from the general fiction (other colors); Stockett’s
                        <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">The Help </hi>is stylistically
                        connected strongest to romantic novels. General fiction by female and male
                        authors hardly form clusters of their own. Except for one ‘male’ cluster
                        which contains a Barnes’ novel and an outlier: Gilbert’s novel – which is
                        seen as a ‘women’s novel’ by our respondents. Weiner, known for opposing the
                        ‘chick lit’ label to her work (Mead, 2014) has a stronger connection to
                        general fiction. In other words, stylistically seen, part of the romantic
                        novels appear to have a specific signature, but most novels by female
                        authors are not obviously stylistically connected to them. </p>

                    <p>Table 2 shows that romantic novels differ from general fiction in some ways:
                        more positive emotions, but no significant difference in negative emotions,
                        more words pertaining to friendship. The romantic novels differ in other
                        ways from either the female or the male-authored literary novels: there are
                        more job-related words in the romantic novels than in female-authored
                        general fiction; less articles and prepositions than male-authored general
                        fiction. Female-authored literary novels and male-authored ones do not
                        significantly differ on any category. This might indicate that when
                        comparing literary fiction to romantic novels, readers choose to focus on
                        commonalities with female authors and differences with male authors, whereas
                        differences between female authors and commonalities with male authors are
                        overlooked. However, we need to be careful with interpretations of <hi
                            rend="italic">t</hi>-tests in <rs type="software">LIWC</rs> (cf. Koolen
                        and van Cranenburgh, 2017). Additional analysis will need to be performed to
                        identify within-group differences. Finally, physicality and the body do not
                        appear to be specific to romantic novels. This finding corroborates earlier
                        research, see Montoro (2012) and Koolen (2018). </p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>Romantic novels appear to be more different from all general fiction than the
                    general fiction differs among authors of female and male gender. They contain
                    signature elements, albeit not all the expected ones (positive emotions and
                    friends, not attention to appearance). Part of the romantic novels are clearly
                    different from general fiction stylistically, but a number of them cluster with
                    male-authored general fiction; most notably work by Gilbert and Weiner. Although
                    further testing is needed, they show that computational stylistic analysis might
                    be used to paint a more objective picture of the actual style of contemporary
                    novels by female authors and the relationships between them. We offer a
                    speculation: if we consider the romantic novels in this corpus to be ‘women’s
                    novels’, there are a several indications that commonalties between
                    female-authored general fiction and romantic novels are stressed heavily and
                    this might be a reason female authors’ novels are judged to have less literary
                    quality. Nevertheless, we do not aim to assert ‘low’ literary quality of the
                    romantic novels, either. To examine gendered quality perceptions further, we
                    will include other fictional genres in future research.</p>
