            <p>In this work we are going to present the 
                <hi rend="italic">Traduco</hi> System, a collaborative web-based application for the translation of the Babylonian Talmud (BT) into Italian. The system has been designed around a computer-assisted translation (CAT) component (Gordon, 1996; Huerta, 2011), constituting its core. However, 
                <hi rend="italic">Traduco</hi> is not limited to assisting the translation process and providing printing functionalities. In fact, it allows linguistic and semantic annotations and advanced searches, paving the way to the construction of a Talmudic knowledge base. In order to achieve these results, the 
                <hi rend="italic">Traduco</hi> development process abided by a model that took into account aspects of Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering. The component-based architectural structure was implemented using the object-oriented Java 2 Enterprise Edition framework.
            </p>
            <p>In particular, each 
                <hi rend="italic">Traduco</hi> component implements specific functionalities targeted at different types of users:
            </p>
            <p> 1.
                <hi rend="bold"> Translators</hi> and 
                <hi rend="bold">revisors</hi> are supported by the use of CAT technologies, including a Translation Memory (TM) designed to ‘remember’ every translated portion of text. The system takes as input the Hebrew text segment to be translated, queries the TM, and suggests the Italian translations relative to the Hebrew text segments recognized to be more similar to the one that has to be translated (Bellandi et al., 2014a), as illustrated in Figure 1.
            </p>
            <p> 2.
                <hi rend="bold"> Philologists</hi> and 
                <hi rend="bold">linguists</hi> can insert notes, comments, and bibliographical references (HaCohen-Kerner, 2010).
            </p>
            <p> 3.
                <hi rend="bold"> Domain experts</hi> are allowed to structure relevant terms into glossaries (for example, proper names, plants, measures, concepts) and, potentially, domain ontologies (Guarino, 1998) represented in Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) or Ontology Web Language (OWL), by using a graphical ontology editor (see Figure 2), which is currently under development (Bellandi et al., 2014b).
            </p>
            <p> 4.
                <hi rend="bold"> Researchers</hi> and 
                <hi rend="bold">scholars</hi> can carry out complex searches on both a linguistic and semantic basis. In more detail, we are developing two morphological analysers, one for Italian and one for Mishnaic Hebrew. These instruments should allow the creation of lexical indices, where each entry (‘lemma’ or ‘root’) will be associated to all its morphologically correlated inflected forms and to all the contexts in which they occur.
            </p>
            <p> 5.
                <hi rend="bold"> Editors</hi> can easily produce the printed edition of the translation of the BT by arranging translations and notes in standard formats for desktop publishing software (typically XML-based, see Figure 3).
            </p>
            <p>Needing a common and shared platform for the translation, revision, and editing of the BT, we went to the Web and the related technologies, providing users the ability to work on the same data collaboratively. Furthermore, it allows the supervisors to keep track, in real time, of the work done by the translators on the portions of the Talmud they were assigned to.</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="italic">Traduco</hi> can be used for translating other texts by adapting its linguistic analysis and semantic annotation components to different languages and domains with relative ease. In particular, the approach employed by 
                <hi rend="italic">Traduco</hi> for the processing of Italian and Hebrew is based on extensively tested and state-of-the-art machine learning technologies (see Bar-Haim et al., 2005; Itai, 2006), built on highly flexible supervised models that can be trained using pre-annotated texts. Concerning the knowledge engineering components, the model allows for the definition of arbitrary semantic classes, thus enabling users to construct specific domain ontologies starting from the annotated terms.
