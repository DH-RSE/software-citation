â€¢ An example of a negative impact of Infinite
Ulysses on the DH community: I deepened digital editions' duplication of the problems with the print literary canon, by building a project around another canon text and author. When only 11 of 86 projects funded by the NEH Preservation & Access Office 2006-2011 had a topic other than a white male writer, I struggle with whether the positive public impacts of my work are worth deepening our problems with authorial representation.
I act as my scholarship's own harshest critic not to paralyze other DH builders from ever making anything, but to make visible specific examples of how in small ways, by adding the skill of care to the skill of critique, we makers can build a better DH and a better world.
