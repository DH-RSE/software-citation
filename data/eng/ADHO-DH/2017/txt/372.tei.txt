the Murkutu Project and the Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage Protocol), the cross-pollination of an interdisciplinary community of digital researchers with tribal communities, cultural heritage organizations, and academic scholars has been significantly underdeveloped. Thus, it is not surprising that there are only a handful of funded digital projects documenting Native American life: the American Indian Treaties Portal, a digital collection of the final texts of 366 of the 375 American Indian treaties recognized by the United States Department of State, and the digitized Journals of Lewis & Clark Expedition created in partnership with the Center for Digital Research at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Mark of the Mississippians: A Multi-Platform Digital Media Project (Cahokia Mounds
Museum Society) and Meeting the Earthworks Builders, a flashbased video game are currently being developed by the Ohio State University.. Additionally, NEH Public Programs just funded Indians of the Midwest, an educational website focused on recent scholarship on Native peoples and the Newberry Library Collection.
The barriers to digital fluency in Native American studies are varied and include such obstacles as cultural rules regarding access to sensitive materials, the advanced technical expertise that software and hardware often requires beyond basic digitization, the costs of digital infrastructure and proprietary license fees, and issues of community engagement and trust that might limit the display of digital materials about Native peoples. It might be tempting to assume that the uptake of digital humanities method and pedagogy in the academic, cultural heritage, and tribal communities is one of lack of information or funding, but in fact the digital humanities researchers included as part of the Digital Native American and Indigenous Studies project are finding that it is also the cultural barriers to access, display, and analysis across differing types of digital materials that are challenging our ability to leverage digital tools, resources, and approaches.
Digital Humanities articulates three parallel interdisciplinary commitments to "openness": 1) a commitment to open access publishing; 2) a commitment to open access/open source software development; and 3) a commitment to open access data. While the first two trends have received deep and lasting attention via scholarly publishing and digital commons enterprises and the open source development movement promoted by github and other code repositories, the commitment to open access data has been largely undertheorized. Using case studies of Digital Humanities projects that have been developed using Native American and Indigenous content, this submission suggests that Native and Indigenous content complicates the current technical application of open source development driven by digital aggregators and application programming interface development. By highlighting ethical issues around the use, reuse, and distributed architectures encouraged by common digital humanities technologies, this submission suggests that the rhetoric and practice of the open access data movement obscures both Native agency in determining the use of community materials as well as the role of technical determinism in proliferating the violence of colonial archives on Native communities. Questions this submission engages with include: How do we deal with born-digital research data in Native American and Indigenous contexts? How do we as scholars responsibly engage in digital research in Native communities? How do organizations and institutions navigate the cultural, legal, and ethical contexts of the communities whose objects they hold? How can free and open source software solutions be leveraged to build community engagement? Finally, what might be recommended for tribal communities who desire to launch their own digital projects but may have concerns about resources, access, infrastructure, and preservation? Bibliography
