Future Work
This method can also be used to quickly identify similar maps and the differences in them. In this way it could be useful for researchers who want to find out which sources were used to create a map or who copied from whom. MapAnalyst (
Jenny and Hurni, 2011
) is an already existing tool for this purpose. If one map is considered as a possible copy of another map, MapAnalyst is a tool used by researchers to explore if this is true. The method proposed in this work would allow doing this kind of analysis on a larger scale while also highlighting the differences between the maps. Although this area was not our primary focus, we plan to evaluate the usefulness of our method on this task.
The information from linked place markers could help in further analysis of other metadata items, such as place type or place name. The linked place markers already make this information available from the other maps and it could for example be used to improve the OCR process of place names.

Figure 3: Visualization of the different steps in the matching procedure for Goos and Mercator, where the Mercator place markers are transformed into the Goos coordinate system.
Triangles represent Goos place markers and squares Mercator ones. Green and red points don't have a mapping to a place marker in the other map, blue and purple ones have mappings. For further explanations see algorithm in main text.
