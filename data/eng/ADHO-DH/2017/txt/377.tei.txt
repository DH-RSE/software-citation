Panel organization
As the discussion is informed by each speaker's local context, each of the three speakers will give a 5-minute introduction of their background and interests (15 minutes total). Each speaker will then interview the other two speakers with a prepared question (2 questions from each speaker, 6 questions total at 5 minutes each, 30 minutes total). At the last part of the panel, we'll open up the discussion for both Q&A and audience sharing; the panelists will moderate the conversation so that everyone gets a chance to contribute. The speakers are:
• Laura Braunstein, Digital Humanities Librarian, Dartmouth College • Thomas Padilla, Humanities Data Curator, University of California Santa Barbara • Amanda Visconti, Managing Director, Scholars' Lab, University of Virginia Library
