Given that long-running television series broadcast hundreds of episodes and the major networks run dozens of series each season, these studies have largely had to rely on a close analysis of a small subset of series, episodes, and even scenes. Our project seeks to augment these approaches with computationallydriven analyses that can curate and aggregate the contents of tens of thousands of hours of television programming. Tracking these over the course of a scene and episode reveal characteristics of how characters interact and describe the narrative flow of the series.

. An example of scene classification from Bewitched. Each still image from the episode is tagged with the description of the sets on the sound stage. Following the progress of these over the course of the episode can serve as a way to compactly describe and aggregate the narrative arc of an episode. Comparing across episodes, seasons and shows reveals similarities and differences across the various series of interest.
