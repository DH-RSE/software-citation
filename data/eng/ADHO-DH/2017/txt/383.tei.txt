Walter Charlton published his Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charltoniana, or, A fabrick of science natural, upon the hypothesis of atoms in 1654. And though Thomas Hobbes never cites
Lucretius directly in his Leviathan (1651), the Latin poet's ideas about the material nature of the universe are a distinct antecedent to Hobbes's mechanical philosophy.
Even around the time of the revival, the reception of the DRN was vexed. Lucretius's statements about the materiality and mortality of the soul, the role of chance in the universe, and the detachment of the gods were far too radical ever to gain wide acceptance in early modern England. In the backlash against Hobbesianism in the 1660s, Lucretius was a prime target for criticism.
Cottegnies (2016)
argues that the backlash against Hobbes's ideas in the 1660s also marks the end of the Epicurean moment. Theologians writing against Hobbes attacked Lucretius's atheistic materialism. And though Lucretius's stature as a poet continued to grow, praise for DRN was almost always tempered. His more extreme ideas were to be dismissed or ignored. In the notes to his translation of DRN in 1682, the first complete translation published in English, Thomas Creech argued against Lucretian and Epicurean attitudes toward the soul and divinity (Creech and Dryden, 1700; these citations refer to the text published using the PhiloLogic build of eebo). John Dryden, the preeminent arbiter of literary taste of his era, quoted Lucretius often in his plays and included translations of select passages in
Sylvae (1685)
. In his preface to that collection, Dryden praised the directness of Lucretius's poetic expression, pointing out the "positive assertion of his Opinion" and his "Magisterial authority." But the subject of his poem is "naturally Crabbed" and the poet himself is "often in the wrong" (Dryden, 1685; text published online by Philologic) .
Reuses and citations found in the Digging into Data database suggest that this basic framework for understanding Lucretius largely played out across the 18th century. Lucretius was at once an admired poet, a materialist attacked for not admitting divine involvement in the universe, and a philosopher who in fact had important things to say about living well. Even so, the alignment database allows us to see a handful of authors, mostly medical and scientific writers, whose views of Lucretius and his ideas veer from this basic narrative. Mainly toward the middle and latter parts of the century, some reuses suggest a less troubled acceptance of Lucretius's naturalism.
Through this presentation, we hope to show that this alignment database, through the accumulation of so many instances of citation, can facilitate a kind of large-scope reading that allows scholars to gain a nuanced sense of longer term intellectual trends. Built on a huge quantity of uncorrected OCR, the database provides scholars the specific source evidence --and a ready means to access it -- that they might need as a starting point to pursue even deeper investigations into the thought of the 18th century.
