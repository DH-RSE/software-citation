Neutralizing Author Signal in Delta
Our proposal is to neutralize the author signal directly on the Delta matrix. We use a testing corpus of texts from three Spanish authors and three subgenres. Detailed information about the corpora, files, parameters and scripts is in our GitHub repository. We applied Cosine Delta (5000 MFW) with Stylo (Eder, Rybicki and Kestemont 2016) and visualized the resulting distance matrix with Python: We see a tendency of lower Delta values for documents of the same author (below 1.0) in comparison to documents of different authors (above 1.0). But what about the closest texts written by a different author? For the historical novel in column E, they are in the rows 14 and 15 and are historical novels, as well. This pattern is found for the majority of the texts. How could we cluster the texts preferring the closest text from other authors? And if we are able to neutralize the author signal, will we see noise or subgenre clusters?
Our proposal is to penalize the distances between the texts of the same author (cf. Lu and Leen 2007 for penalization in image clustering), making them closer to the average distance of texts of different authors, then cluster the neutralized distance matrix and measure the cluster homogeneity by author and subgenre.
We define the set of all documents by an author a as Aa, the collection containing all documents by all authors as C and total number of documents in the collection is defined as c:
Note that each document is in exactly one author-document set Ai.
First, we calculate the average distance of texts of all pairwise different authors (in
fig. 2
, all the distances in black). We call this value the mean of different authors or M(C) and for this collection its value is 1.16.
Second, we calculate the mean of the texts of each author a M
(Aa) (in fig. 2, the distances in grey)
. The values in grey are now in general above 1.0: the texts of the same author have been separated, showing relations between texts independently of authorship. Now the adventure and historical novels of Baroja in columns C and D have their closest text in works of different authors but belonging to the same subgenre. In comparison with
Figure 1
, this dendrogram allows us to see new text relations beyond authorship but within subgenre, showing clusters with different authors but the same subgenre: for example, the cluster of historical novels by Baroja and Valle or the two very close subclusters of erotic novels by Miró and Valle.
Tests and Evaluation
For the evaluation, the homogeneity of the clusters
(Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007
) was measured. This measure yields values between 0 and 1. As ground truth, the metadata about author and subgenre have been used. The results for the dummy corpus: The homogeneity of the clusters of Cosine Delta (see
fig. 1
) are perfect for authors and much lower for subgenre, because the author clusters contain subgenre subclusters. The homogeneity of the clusters of Neutralized Delta (see
fig. 5
) is lower for authorship (as expected), but not for subgenre. In this case the neutralization of the author signal only deteriorates the homogeneity for authorship but improves the homogeneity for subgenre. We have analysed different subgenres present in the whole corpus for test the method. We created subcorpora of historical, bildungsroman, erotic and adventure novels: 5
Figure 7: Homogeneities for Spanish prose subcorpora
As expected, the neutralization consistently deteriorates the homogeneity for author (between -0.26 and -0.1) while the homogeneity for subgenre is not deteriorated (between -0.08 and 0.06). The homogeneity for subgenre of adventure compared to erotic and bildungsroman get the best results (over 0.9) and they even improved on results with Cosine. Adventure novels are also best recognized in classification tasks
(Het- tinger et al. 2016
). Subgenres which are very difficult to differentiate like historical and adventure (Pedraza
Rodríguez Cáceres 1983: 672 and
1987: 459)
get one of the worst results.
The results are similar when testing other corpora, such as a corpus of French drama (
Schöch et al. 2015
) and a corpus of Spanish American novels:

Conclusion and future work
Our main goal was to present a method to neutralize the Delta distances of the same author using the difference between the mean of the author and the mean of different authors. Tested on eight subcorpora, this procedure, as we expected, deteriorates the homogeneity of authorship clusters but maintains the subgenre homogeneity, improving it for some cases. That discovers relations between texts (see
fig. 5
) that were hidden by authorship. This procedure brings a new way of working with Delta beyond authorship attribution.
Both Cosine and Neutralized Delta show very different results for the comparison of different subgenres, something which points to the different internal structure of the subgenres. The comparison of very different subgenres (like adventure against erotic or bildungsroman) gets higher subgenre cluster homogeneity. Neutralized Delta could be used for comparing different corpora of specific subgenres and test the significance of the results to better characterize these subgenres. In an ideal scenario, we would like to test on a perfect balanced corpus where a set of authors are represented in all subgenres of the same period.
For future work, we will analyse how different parameters like versions of Delta or number of MFW affect the results. We also plan to transfer the approach to an earlier step in the Delta procedure and penalize the word z-score vectors.
We look forward to the feedback of the international DH community about this new use of the very effective "expression of difference, pure difference" which is Delta.
