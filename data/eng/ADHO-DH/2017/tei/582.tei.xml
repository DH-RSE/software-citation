				<head>Introduction</head>
				<p>This talk explores how new vector-based approaches to computational semantics
					both afford new methods to digital humanities research, and raise interesting
					questions for eighteenth-century literary studies in particular. New semantic
					models known as &quot;word embedding models&quot; have generated excitement recently in
					the natural language processing and machine learning communities, due to their
					ability to represent and predict semantic relationships as complex as analogy.
					&quot;Man&quot; is to &quot;woman&quot; as &quot;king&quot; is to what?, one can ask of the model; &quot;queen,&quot; it
					will most likely reply. These models formulate analogical and other semantic
					relationships by computing mathematical vectors for words, such that, if V(x)
					denotes the vector for the word x, then the above analogy can be expressed as
					V(woman) - V(man) + V(king) â‰ˆ V(queen). Although these models have a longer
					history- vector space semantics dates from the &apos;70s, having been first developed
					for the SMART information retrieval system <ref type="bibr">(Sal- ton,
						1971)</ref> by Gerard Salton and his colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Salton et al, 1975</ref>)&quot; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Turney and Pantel, 2010)</ref>- new innovations in their speed and
					accuracy (see Note <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>) have renewed researchers&apos;
					interests-a development begun, in part, by Google, when researchers there
					unveiled newly efficient algorithms in 2013, packaged in software they released
					called <rs type="software">word2vec</rs>. (The <rs type="software">word2vec</rs> algorithm was originally described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mikolov et al, 2013</ref>. It introduced the neural
					network to vector space semantics, providing an efficient means by which to
					compute word vectors. The GloVe algorithm from the Stanford NLP Group eschews
					the neural network approach, instead performing a novel method of dimensionality
					reduction on word collocation counts).</p>
				<p>&quot;Word vectors,&quot; as these new methods are sometimes informally called, have
					already enabled published research into questions relevant to humanistic
					research, such as a recent landmark paper from researchers in the Stanford NLP
					Group into patterns of semantic change across centuries of discourse (Hamilton
					et al). However, unfortunately, word vectors have so far rarely appeared in
					research from the digital humanities community itself. Moreover, what work that
					does exist has so far been primarily circulated through blogs, rather than
					through published proceedings or articles. Ben Schmidt, for instance, has
					written an influential introduction to word vectors in his blog post &quot;Vector
					Space Models for the Digital Humanities&quot; (2015a), which also includes a
					documented R package for computing them. Also notable is his post, &quot;Rejecting
					the gender binary&quot; <ref type="bibr">(Schmidt, 2015b)</ref>, which uses word
					vectors to dissect the polysemy of words; as well as Michael Gavin&apos;s post, &quot;The
					Arithmetic of Concepts&quot; (2015), which explores the conceptual implications of
					adding and subtracting word vectors.</p>
				<p>On the whole, the current research landscape of word vectors in the digital
					humanities resembles the landscape of topic modeling years ago, when the
					original LDA algorithm (published in 2003 <ref type="bibr">[Blei et al]</ref>),
					before appearing in landmark published DH studies such as Matt Jockers&apos;
					Macroanalysis (2013), was employed for humanistic research as early as 2006 by
					researchers working outside or tangentially to the digital humanities (Newman
					and Block).</p>
				<p>Given this scarcity of digital-humanities research on word vectors, work that
					seeks equally to explain, interpret, and demonstrate their potential seems
					particularly useful. With these goals in mind, this paper attempts first to
					unpack for a digital-humanities audience how word vectors work, with reference
					to the canonical analogy cited above: &quot;man is to woman as king is to queen.&quot;
					Second, in order to interpret word vectors&apos; conceptual implications for
					eighteenth-century literature, I move away from this canonical analogy to one
					central to a particularly influential argument in the period: &quot;Learning is to
					Genius as Riches are to Virtue.&quot; Lastly, I turn from this close reading of word
					vectors to methods of distant-reading analogies that lie implicit in
					eighteenth-century literature.</p>

				<head>Explaining Word Vectors</head>
				<p>How do word vectors work? In the interests of space, I have omitted this section
					of my talk from the abstract. Readers curious about the mechanics of word
					vectors can read more on my blog, which also links to a number of other
					explanatory resources (Heuser, &quot;Methods&quot;).</p>

			<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
				<head>Close-reading Word Vectors</head>
				<p>Word vectors provide a persuasive computational means for the semantic
					representation and analysis of analogies. They combine a mathematical elegance
					with an intuitive interpretability to yield what is, potentially, a method
					useful not only for large-scale semantic analysis, but also for smaller-scale
					explorations of particular analogies in literature, and their specific forms of
					analogical argumentation. For instance, analogy lies at the heart of Edward
					Young&apos;s essay Conjectures on Original Composition (1759), which argued for the
					superior aesthetic interest of modern, &quot;original&quot; composition over the
					neoclassical imitation of the ancients. Crucially, Young makes his argument
					through analogy, identifying several other conceptual contrasts as analogues to
					his central one between original and imitative composition: &quot;I would compare
					Genius to Virtue, and Learning to Riches,&quot; Young writes; &quot;[a]s Riches are most
					wanted where there is least Virtue; so Learning where there is least Genius.&quot; In
					this way, Young&apos;s valuation of &quot;Genius&quot; over &quot;Learning,&quot; and of original over
					imitative composition, become ethically justified through their analogy with
					another, more obviously moral contrast between &quot;Virtue&quot; and &quot;Riches.&quot;</p>
				<p>But what is the logic behind this analogy? Here, word vectors provide the close
					reader with a framework, language, and method of exploring the semantic
					implications at work in an analogy. In terms of vectors, we can ask, what does
					V(Virtue)-V(Riches) (Also sometimes expressed here, in a shorthand, as
					V(VirtueRiches) mean, and is it in fact correlated with V(Genius)-V(Learning) in
					the broader discourse of the period? Asking this question of a <rs type="software">word2vec</rs> model
					trained on the 80 million words of eighteenth-century literature in the ECCO-TCP
					corpus, we find that &quot;Riches&quot; are to &quot;Virtue&quot; as &quot;Learning&quot; is to... &quot;Genius&quot; is
					the sixth closest word vector, or the sixth most likely solution, to this
					analogy. How to test the significance of this result is not immediately clear,
					but, out of tens of thousands of possibilities, it&apos;s certainly provocative: it
					raises the possibility that word vectors might provide computational assistance
					to close readings. Indeed, the other words in this list amplify the semantic
					profile of this analogy in a way that might help to clarify its underlying
					implications. For instance, the contrast between the intrinsic form of value in
					&quot;Virtue&quot; and the extrinsic form of value in &quot;Riches&quot; seems underscored for me by
					the contrast here between the extrinsic writerly attribute of &quot;Learning,&quot;
					associated with an Oxbridge education, and the intrinsic attributes of morality,
					genius, and wisdom.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, however, what does it mean to closeread word vectors? This is a
					question raised by Gabriel Recchia in a blogpost responding to my interpretation
					above as it first appeared on my blog (Recchia; Heuser, &quot;Concepts&quot;). Recchia&apos;s
					post explores other vector operations that even more reliably yield &quot;genius,&quot;
					namely V(learning)+V(virtue) and V(talents)+V(abilities)+V(erudition). To me,
					however, these alternative &quot;paths&quot; to genius do not exclude one another;
					instead, each contributes to our understanding of the semantics of genius in the
					period. My goal with this interpretation is not to &quot;prove&quot; Young&apos;s analogy, but
					rather to suggest that, by &quot;amplifying&quot; a particular analogy through its
					semantic associations across a corpus, word vectors help contextualize our
					interpretations of particular analogies in literature. As Recchia writes, &quot;the
					computational exercise has helped us focus our search.&quot;</p>
			</div>

				<head>Distant-reading Word Vectors</head>
				<p>If, then, vectors help us explore this micro-analytic scale of interpretation,
					they also help us scale those same interpretive models up to the level of
					macroanalysis. For instance, inspired by the foregoing closereading of Young&apos;s
					complex web of analogies <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, we
					might continue Young&apos;s project of obsessive analogization by way of a distant
					reading. By defining vectors for a range of common eighteenth-century contrasts
						<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>, and then measuring the
					correlation between them, we can in fact construct another complex web of
					analogies-this time gleaned computationally, from a large-scale archive of the
					period&apos;s discourse. <ref type="formula">(1748)</ref>, as well as a number of
					essays from the period; they are not meant to be exhaustive. This is an
					admittedly unsatisfactory method; I am currently exploring ways to discover
					conceptual contrasts computationally.</p>
				<p>Looking at a particularly strong correlation among the contrasts in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, between V(Simplicity-Refinement)
					and V(Virtue-Vice), we can see how their correlation emerges from the way in
					which both contrasts carry similar semantic associations across the same set of
					words <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref>). . 1,000 most frequent
					nouns in the ECCO-TCP corpus. On the x-axis is their cosine similarity with the
					V(Simplicity-Refinement) vector: if above 0, then associated more with
					refinement; if below, more with simplicity. Conversely, on the y-axis, above 0
					means associated more with Vice; below 0, more with Virtue.</p>
				<p>In other words, this graph shows that there are more words for simple virtues
					(e.g. &quot;graces&quot;) than refined virtues (e.g. &quot;science&quot;), and more words for
					refined vices (e.g. &quot;corruption&quot;) than simple vices (e.g. &quot;murder&quot;). This
					correlation between their semantic associations (R^2 = 0.41) reveals, then, an
					analogy emerging from the period&apos;s broader discursive practices-Simplicity is to
					Refinement as Virtue is to Vice-even as that analogy might appear only
					implicitly in particular essays, such as in Hume&apos;s &quot;Of Simplicity and Refinement
					in Writing&quot; (1742), when Hume loosely associates refinement with the moral
					decline of post-Augustan Rome.</p>
				<p>This macro-analytic approach to discovering implicit discursive analogies allows
					us to visualize the ways in which the frequent conceptual contrasts in
					eighteenth-century literature are implicitly analogized in the discourse, and
					how those implicit analogical relationships may have helped to structure what
					Peter De Bolla has called the &quot;conceptual architecture&quot; of the period <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). the R^2 value of their correlation, across
					the 1,000 most frequent nouns (as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure
						3</ref>), is greater than 0.1. Blue lines read in the natural order (e.g.
					Simplicity is to Refinement as Woman is to Man); red lines read in reverse order
					(e.g. Simplicity is to Refinement as the King is to Parliament). Nodes are sized
					by betweenness centrality, and colored by network community. Edges are sized by
					the R^2 value.</p>
				<p>From this network of correlated contrasts, we can see which of them, for
					instance, are implicitly gendered in the period&apos;s discourse. &quot;Woman&quot; is to
					&quot;man,&quot; for instance, as &quot;queen&quot; is to &quot;king&quot;-but also as the beautiful is to the
					sublime, as simplicity is to refinement, and as passion is to reason. Similarly,
					we can see which contrasts are moralized in the period: &quot;virtue&quot; is to &quot;vice&quot; as
					wisdom is to folly, as pity is to fear, as the mind is to the body. Moreover,
					the contrasts of virtue and vice, and simplicity and refinement, might actually
					play a central role in such a conceptual architecture of analogies, as seen from
					their centrality within the network.</p>

				<head>Conclusion</head>
				<p>I hope to have demonstrated some of the ways in which word vectors might be
					useful for the digital humanities, and particularly for eighteenth-century
					literary studies, both by demonstrating how they might help us to close-read
					specific analogical maneuvers, as well as distant-read analogies as they emerge
					from patterns in their usage across a literary discourse.</p>

				<head>Notes</head>
				<p>[1] According to statistics provided in the original paper for the Stanford NLP
					group&apos;s &quot;GloVe,&quot; a competing algorithm to <rs type="software">word2vec</rs>, a <rs type="software">word2vec</rs> model trained on
					a large English-language corpus can accurately solve 65% of analogies in a test
					dataset, and GloVe 75% (Pennington et al, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). As a rough comparison to the accuracy we would expect from
					human subjects, we might look to the Miller Analogy Test from Pearson-an
					admittedly unrelated analogy test, which is given to some graduate student
					applicants. In the MAT of 2002-3, to accurately solve 65% or more of its 100
					analogies places a student above the 80th percentile (Pearson). Although not
					directly comparable, these statistics make more probable the assessment that
					word vectors are capable of capturing semantic relationships at a level
					competitive with human subjects.</p>
