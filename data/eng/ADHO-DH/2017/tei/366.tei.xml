				<head>Introduction</head>
				<p><rs type="software">nodegoat</rs> allows scholars to build datasets based on
					their own data model and offers relational modes of analysis with spatial and
					chronological forms of contextualisation. By combining these elements within one
					environment, scholars are able to instantly process, analyse and visualise
					complex datasets relationally, diachronically and spatially; trailblazing. <rs
						type="software">nodegoat</rs> follows an object-oriented approach throughout
					its core functionalities. Borrowing from actor-network theory this means that
					people, events, artefacts, and sources are treated as equal: objects, and
					hierarchy depends solely on the composition of the network: relations. This
					object-oriented approach advocates the self-identification of individual objects
					and maps the correlation of objects within the collective.</p>

				<head>Research Environment</head>
				<p><rs type="software">nodegoat</rs> is a web-based research environment that
					facilitates an object-oriented form of data management with an integrated
					support for diachronic and spatial modes of analysis. This research environment
					has been developed to allow scholars to design custom relational database
					models. <rs type="software">nodegoat</rs> dynamically combines functionalities
					of a database management system (e.g. Access/FileMaker) with visualisation
					possibilities (e.g. <rs type="software">Gephi</rs>/Palladio) and extends these
					functionalities (e.g. in-text referencing, LOD-module) in one web-based GUI. As
					a result, <rs type="software">nodegoat</rs> offers researchers an environment
					that seamlessly combines data management functionalities with the ability to
					analyse and visualise data.</p>
				<p>The explorative nature of <rs type="software">nodegoat</rs> allows researchers to
					trailblaze through data; instead of working with static &apos;pushes&apos; - or
					exports - of data, data is dynamically &apos;pulled&apos; within its context
					each time a query is fired. The environment can be used in selfdefined
					collaborative configurations with varying clearance levels for different groups
					of users.</p>
				<p>As a result of <rs type="software">nodegoat</rs>&apos;s object-oriented set-up,
					everything is an object. In the case of a research project on correspondence
					networks, this means that a researcher would define three types of objects in
						<rs type="software">nodegoat</rs>: &apos;letter&apos;, &apos;person&apos;,
					&apos;city&apos;. Each object relates to an other object via relations (e.g. a
					letter relates to persons to identify the sender/receiver and this letters has
					been sent from/received in a city). In an extended research process, researchers
					could also define themselves as objects in the dataset, their sources or other
					datasets. Due to the focus on relations and associations between heterogeneous
					types of objects, the platform is equipped to perform analyses spanning
					multitudes of objects. By enriching objects with chronological and geospatial
					attributed associations, the establishment and the evolution of networks of
					objects is fully contextualised. In <rs type="software">nodegoat</rs>, these
					contexts and sets of networked data can be instantly visualised through time and
					space. This open-ended approach makes <rs type="software">nodegoat</rs>
					different from tools like the Social Networks and Archival Context Project, Alan
					Liu&apos;s Research Oriented Social Environment, the Software Environment for
					the Advancement of Scholarly Research, Prosop, or tools with a main focus on
					coding of qualitative data as seen in various computer-assisted qualitative data
					analysis software. With its object-oriented approach, <rs type="software"
						>nodegoat</rs> facilitates the aggregation of collections, coding of texts,
					and analysis of networks, but models these methods towards the creation and
					contextualisation of single objects that move through time and space.</p>
