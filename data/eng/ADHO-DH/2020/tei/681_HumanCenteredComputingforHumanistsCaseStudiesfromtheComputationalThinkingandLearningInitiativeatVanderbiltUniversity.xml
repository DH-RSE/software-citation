            <p>The Computational Thinking and Learning Initiative (CTLI) at Vanderbilt University
                formed out of an awareness that, across society and academe, computation is changing
                the nature of knowledge. As the practices and methods for producing, sharing, and
                contesting knowledge change, the enterprise of the university—its disciplinary
                scholarship, liberal arts mission, and charge to prepare professionals for the world
                of work—is being reshaped by algorithmic norms. The rise of computational thinking
                as a transdisciplinary category holds both promise and peril for the humanities. How
                can humanists, especially digital humanists, take advantage of the push for
                computational thinking across the curriculum while avoiding the dangers of
                appropriation? Alternatively, how can those developing and refining computational
                methods tap into the critical perspectives of the humanities? This paper discusses
                how an interdisciplinary group of colleagues is drawing on the theory of
                human-centered computing to develop environments and curricula for students of the
                humanities to explore the basics of text mining while also providing them with space
                to critique and resist the imposition of algorithmic rationality.</p>
            <p>The CTLI foregrounds a particular image of computational thinking across the
                curriculum, working to identify, stabilize, and study new forms of human-computer
                partnership that are responsive to disciplinary ways of knowing. Our aim is to study
                new ways in which individuals or groups of humans, along with computers or groups of
                computational entities, can come together productively and critically as collective
                computational-thinking units and build on complementary strengths to investigate
                problems while rejecting facile technical solutions. The perspective of
                human-centered computing, that is, the “design of computing systems with a human
                focus from beginning to end,”1 functions as an Archimedean point of our
                collaboration.</p>
            <p>A trans-institutional group of researchers and scholars have assembled at the CTLI,
                including faculty from the schools of arts and science, engineering, and education
                as well as the library and the data sciences institute. Together, we are exploring
                how human-centered computing collaborations transform epistemologies, practices, and
                pedagogies across disciplines.</p>
            <p>Following the programmatic overview that Anderson and Ramey presented at DH2019,2
                these collaborators selected textual analysis as one of two focus areas (the other
                being climate change) for the first year of the initiative. Using NetsBlox,3 a
                block-based programming environment developed at Vanderbilt University, we
                constructed components and curricula to teach students in the humanities the
                fundamentals of computational thinking (variables, looping, functions, recursion,
                etc.) by manipulating textual corpora rather than matrices of numbers. We wanted
                this environment to be &quot;low threshold&quot; enough for middle and high school
                students to use it as an entry point to disciplinary inquiry, while having a
                sufficiently &quot;high ceiling&quot; to allow scholars of literature and history to
                use it meaningfully as well.</p>
            <p>Given our commitment to discipline-specific visions of computational thinking, our
                pilot project attempted to understand how the professional vision4 of the humanist
                might resonate with the technological capacity of new computational tools and
                methods. We viewed human-computer collaboration as an integration of
                productively-different ways of interacting with the objects of analysis (e.g.,
                texts). Computers and humans “read” differently, and the trick was to find a way to
                put these ways-of-reading into conversation. We used design-based research5 to
                investigate possibilities, supporting and studying scholars&apos; creative efforts
                to engage with technological tools and achieve what they regarded as progress on
                humanistic projects. We then developed a learning environment that enabled younger
                students to take on similar relations to computational tools, but in simpler,
                playful settings. Working with the same computational approaches at different levels
                of complexity and sophistication, we aimed to gain new perspectives on their power
                and limitations. We explored a design space with scholars and students centered on
                the analysis of style and affect in poetry, iteratively identifying and testing
                functionality with the ultimate objective of creating activities for both
                secondary-school and undergraduate courses.</p>
            <p>In the course of our explorations, we narrowed the team’s focus to three different
                technologies for textual analysis: (i) fundamental natural language processing
                concepts such as named entity recognition; (ii) word embeddings, such as <rs
                    type="software">Word2Vec</rs>;6 and (iii) a “query runner” to TEI-encoded
                documents in BaseX,7 a native XML database. During our collaboration, the team
                applied each of these technologies, first playfully, to explore what insights they
                could yield with familiar and constructed texts; then more deliberately, in settings
                in which it was likely that the computer’s “readings” might be put in productive
                conversation with humans’ readings. Finally, the team proposed questions, on the one
                hand, that revealed new patterns in larger corpora; and activities, on the other,
                that engaged younger learners in reflecting on style as a feature of writing under
                the writer’s control.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we report on this first year’s effort and our progress in building a
                block-based computing environment and curriculum that supports textual analysis by
                both high school students and professors of literature. We discuss how these tools
                and perspectives scaffold activities as diverse as teaching secondary students about
                the linguistic differences between poetry and prose and detecting stylistic patterns
                among Victorian writers. We also discuss the limitations of taking a human-centered
                computing approach when conducting digital humanities research; in particular, we
                examine the drawbacks of block-based languages for text mining in comparison with
                tools like Lexos8 and <rs type="software">Voyant</rs>.9</p>
