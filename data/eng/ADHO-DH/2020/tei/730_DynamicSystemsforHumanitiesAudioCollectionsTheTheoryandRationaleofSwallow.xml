            <p>Dynamic Systems for Humanities Audio Collections: The Theory and Rationale of Swallow </p>
            <p>Jason Camlot, Tomasz Neugebauer, Francisco Berrizbeitia</p>
            <p>This paper approaches a system that has been designed, and continues to be in
                development, for the aggregation of metadata surrounding collections of documentary
                literary sound recordings, as an object for theoretical and practical discussion of
                how information about diverse collections of time-based media should be managed, and
                what such schema and system development means for our engagement with the contents
                of such collections as artifacts of humanist inquiry. Swallow (Swallow Metadata
                Management System 2019), the interoperable spoken-audio metadata ingest system
                project that is the boundary object for this talk, emerged out of the goals of the
                SpokenWeb SSHRC Partnership Grant research network to digitize, process, describe,
                and aggregate the metadata of a diverse range of sound collections documenting
                literary and cultural activity in Canada since the 1950s. Our talk, collaboratively
                written and delivered by a literary scholar and critical theorist, a digital
                projects and systems development librarian, and a library developer / programmer,
                outlines 1) a theoretical rationale for the audiotext as a significant form of data
                in the humanities, 2) consequent modes of description deemed necessary to render
                such data useful for humanities scholars, and 3) a rationale for the development of
                a specific form of database system given the material and systems contexts that
                inform our national holdings of documentary literary sound recordings at the present
                time.</p>

            <p> Rationale of digitized audiotexts as humanities research data </p>
            <p>Why is the study of literary recordings important? With the introduction of viable
                sound recording technology in the last decade of the nineteenth century, a new form
                of material data for literary analysis emerged: the audiotext. This new literary
                artifact, based on the sound signal of the poet&#8217;s acoustic performance, has
                been defined as &#8220;a semantically denser field of linguistic activity&#8221;
                that demands new methods of analysis (Bernstein). Once digitized, engagement with
                sound recordings move us further down the path of understanding &#8220;The
                Text&#8221; as &#8220;a methodological field&#8221; (Barthes), and towards
                increasingly elaborate &#8220;rationales of audio text&#8221; (Clement) realized in
                relation to information systems for the purposes of software analysis, content
                modeling, and cataloguing. The digitized archive of voices invites the production of
                thorough metadata, and thus expands the ways in which we may remodel our
                understanding of historical cultural artifacts (Camlot 2019, Camlot and Mitchell,
                Gitelman). Over the past two decades, due in part to the founding of online
                repositories of literary recordings like PennSound (PennSound center for programs in
                contemporary writing at the University of Pennsylvania 2020) and SpokenWeb
                (SpokenWeb 2020) the potential of the literary sound archive for research has become
                discernible. The implications of such research are momentous for future
                methodologies in the humanities, and yet the realization of such research is
                limited, at present, by the status and structure of our collections of literary
                sound recordings. In Canada, thousands of hours of literary readings, performance
                and related activities have been recorded on magnetic tape since the 1950s. The
                affordances of tape recording and subsequent media technologies enabled new literary
                uses of sound recording, including the documentation of literary events, readings
                and conversations, both public and private. This extended the reach of capturing
                literary forms and events, and consequently, transformed our understanding of what
                comprised the literary and cultural events. As valuable archival materials, these
                recordings represent a massive, largely untapped, undifferentiated, and often
                undiscovered resource for the study of literary art, culture and society. Research
                in literary sound studies depends upon a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach
                to the development of historical knowledge about these valuable cultural heritage
                materials, and of a networked structure of digital repositories and research-focused
                interfaces for the preservation and meaningful presentation of these materials to
                researchers, students, artists and the public. Swallow, the metadata system we
                launched in 2019 and intend to augment into a robust tool for sharing metadata about
                our national audio holdings across multiple institutions and a diverse range of
                metadata and access systems, is a coded software system that represents and works to
                realize the theoretical idea of audiotexts as significant digital humanities
                data.</p>
            <p>A Poetics of Audio Description, or, a Metadata Schema for Literary Audio</p>
            <p>The diversity of recordings held at SpokenWeb partner institutions across Canada
                include recorded conversations, dictations, compilations, performances, interviews
                and lectures, among numerous other generic audiotextual categories. How do we begin
                to describe the features and contents of such recordings, and in what ways may we
                make collections of documentary sound recordings speak to each other, beyond their
                local venues of origin and siloed media formats and archives?</p>
            <p>Metadata and its structure has the potential to open and limit avenues of research.
                The aggregation of metadata from partner institutions requires either choosing an
                existing access system, such as Islandora (Islandora Open source digital asset
                management 2020) or Avalon (Avalon Media System 2020), with its own metadata schema,
                or to design one based on the evolving research needs of the project. We have chosen
                the latter because we do not wish to limit our research questions to any single
                digital repository platform. During the extensive metadata collection phase of our
                research program, we are seeking maximum usability. We are pursuing our work in
                describing the assets and contents of collections of documentary literary sound
                recordings using an agile, iterative development process. We have developed our
                long-form metadata schema over the course of a year through the research,
                discussion, and regular meetings of a SpokenWeb Metadata Task Force consisting of
                librarians, literary researchers and students from across our partnership. We have
                provided the metadata schema (Camlot et al. 2020) and ingest software out to student
                cataloguers quickly for testing and feedback, so that the schema has been shaped by
                research use from the outset, and will continue to be shaped by researcher feedback
                throughout this seven-year cataloguing project. We based the SpokenWeb schema on
                standards such as IASA (International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives
                1999), AACR2 (Joint Steering Committee for Revision of AACR 2005) and MODS (Library
                of Congress 2018), focusing on the most useful simplified instructions for the
                audiotext metadata context.</p>
            <p>The initial result was a SpokenWeb Metadata Schema with standard core fields such as:
                Title, Rights, Creators/Contributors, Production Context, enre, and Contents. The
                material artifact description recommendations in the schema include detailed
                sub-fields reflecting research interest, such as: AV Type, Material Designation,
                Physical Composition, Storage Capacity, Extent, Playing Speed, Track Configuration,
                Playback Mode, Tape Brand. The digital file description was a multiple field from
                the beginning, allowing for multiple files per material artifact. We later added
                Contents and Notes sub-fields that are capable of storing XML markup to Digital File
                Description, to make it possible to associate content annotations for each of the
                files in case of multi-file items. Following feedback from cataloguers who
                encountered event recording spanning multiple artifacts, it made sense to make
                Material Description into a multiple field as well. Other examples of changes
                include: the addition of &#8220;Performance Date&#8221; to Date Types and
                &#8220;Classroom recording&#8221; to Production Context.We recognized the research
                need to catalogue event/venue names and locations early on, and included location
                subfields for venue names, latitude and longitude, links to OpenStreetMap nodes, and
                notes for additional context.</p>
            <p>For qualifying and describing authorship, we predefined a controlled vocabulary by
                selecting from the Library of Congress relators those roles relevant to audiotext,
                such as interviewer, author, presenter. In the second iteration of the schema, we
                made it possible to associate multiple roles for a contributor, and following
                feedback from one of our partner institutions working with First Nations content, we
                added the role of &#8220;Elder&#8221;. In addition, soon after the launch of
                Swallow, the First Nations Metis and Inuit Indigenous Ontology was released, and we
                added the Nation subfield and controlled vocabulary lookup based on this for
                Creators/Contributors. </p>
            <p>The Contents field has been designed to facilitate navigation, searching and linking
                audio content of one recording to a wide collection of others. The inclusion of a
                Related Works field is one way to facilitate linking. The content information needs
                to be able to include time stamped structural and descriptive information about the
                works and creators on the recordings. There are many possible tools and formats to
                perform this type of time stamped metadata. Swallow allows for the storage of
                contents field information using text or XML markup. We also developed
                recommendations for how to annotate literary audio for the project and a
                Python/Flask script to convert text formatted annotations to Avalon XML (Neugebauer
                2020). Avalon&#8217;s XML format for audio annotations was extended slightly to make
                it possible to package multiple digital files&#8217; annotations into a single
                Avalon XML file.&#160;&#160;</p>
            <p>Swallow and the rationale for an iterative database design</p>
            <p> The SpokenWeb collections are diverse and dispersed in archives and different
                repository systems. The networked approach we have pursued has allowed the research
                network to proceed with aggregating the metadata from partners without having to
                limit the infrastructure by choosing only one repository system with its associated
                metadata schema. However, we have also needed to move beyond spreadsheets, to
                improve the accuracy and usability of the cataloguing work. A spreadsheet of
                metadata quickly becomes difficult to manage as the number of columns increases to
                accommodate multiple fields, to catalogue multiple creators/contributors, for
                example. In addition, the research requirements of the project call for a highly
                customizable and extendible set of metadata fields that will change over time as we
                analyze and catalogue the content and learn more about the collections. We needed to
                be able to rapidly iterate new versions of interfaces for evolving metadata schema.
                Our solution has been to avoid hardcoding the metadata schema into the relational
                database, and instead to store the metadata as unstructured JSON inside the
                database. A layer of abstraction then allows us to quickly modify configuration
                files that define the metadata fields and their associated controlled vocabularies
                and lookups. The resulting system&#8217;s cataloguing interface may then be changed
                quickly, and is able to accommodate multiple schemas. Indeed, we have implemented
                numerous additions and changes to the metadata system over the course of our first
                year of cataloguing in response to the nature of specific collections we are
                describing.</p>
            <p>Swallow makes it possible for literary audio holding institutions to aggregate their
                metadata in a single system. The required metadata fields for access and
                preservation can change over time and vary by document type and source institution.
                Swallow allows for the aggregation of metadata in multiple metadata schemas in the
                same system. It generates a schema-specific cataloguing interface for each item
                stored, based on the item&#8217;s respective schema configuration files that include
                a list of steps, metadata fields and controlled vocabularies. The Swallow schema
                specification functionality currently allows for the inclusion of URIs alongside
                metadata values that are a part of the SpokenWeb Schema, such as links to VIAF,
                OpenStreetMap, Wikidata, and Rights Statements.&#160;&#160;</p>
            <p>Future developmentFigure 2 shows the proposed flow of information with Swallow at the
                center acting as a central metadata repository. The functionality that we are
                proposing to develop includes the capacity to batch ingest metadata from other
                systems currently used by SpokenWeb partners into the latest version of the
                SpokenWeb schema in Swallow. The functionality to access batch import mappings on
                the interface exists, and we will develop the mappings for Islandora, Avalon, and
                AtoM in collaboration with partner institutions, Concordia Spectrum Research
                Repository, SFU Radar, University of Alberta Dataverse, University of Toronto
                (Dataverse), UBC Brain Circuits (FRDR). The proposed functionality includes the
                development of batch editing that would allow cataloguers to modify the metadata of
                collections of items. We will also develop mapping specifications that will allow
                for the migration of items catalogued in one schema version into another. The
                proposed development would build into the interface the functionality to lookup and
                export metadata from Swallow to Wikidata. In addition, we will develop mappings for
                export of collections of metadata as data from Swallow to DataVerse and FRDR
                (Canadian Association of Research Libraries &amp; Compute Canada 2020) .</p>

            <p>Conclusion Our work in metadata and systems development can be read as the
                development as a poetics of the audiotext, that is a poesis (a making) of the
                descriptive and digital infrastructure that allows digitized audio artifacts &#8211;
                artifacts that capture the sound of literature in its social contexts during the
                postwar era &#8211; to survive and take flight in the imaginations of contemporary
                critics, scholars, poets and listeners.</p>
