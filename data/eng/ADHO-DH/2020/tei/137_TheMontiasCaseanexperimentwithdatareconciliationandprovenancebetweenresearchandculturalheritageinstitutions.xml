        <body><p>This paper discusses the complex process of reconciliation of data coming from
                research and public cultural heritage institutions with their own selection criteria
                that have shaped the provenance of their collections. We demonstrate how the <rs ana="#URL" key="Golden_Agents">Golden
                Agents</rs> digital humanities research infrastructure [1] can play an intersecting role
                as intermediary data provider between these distributed collections in the
                reconciliation, disambiguation and deduplication of data by taking their provenance
                into account. To this end we analyse an art historical case we call &#8216;The
                Montias Case&#8217;, with data from three different sources: the Getty Provenance
                Index, [2] the Frick Collection, [3] and the notarial acts of the Amsterdam City
                Archives. [4]</p><p>In the 1980s, John Michael Montias (1928-2005) began to compile
                a database containing records of ownership of works of art of the Dutch Golden Age.
                To this end he also selected records from the Amsterdam City Archives using
                inventories dated 1597-1681. In 1985 and 1987, Montias was invited to the Getty
                Research Institute to automate his work and incorporate it into the Getty Provenance
                Index. When his collaboration with the Getty concluded around 1990, Montias
                continued his project and donated his work to the Frick Art Reference Library. Both
                datasets were enriched by others. The Getty Provenance Index and the Frick
                Collection have now two partially overlapping datasets with a shared provenance that
                are in need of deduplication/disambiguation to fully exploit them for art-historical
                research. </p><p>The Getty Research Institute and the Golden Agents consortium set
                up an experiment in 2019 to reconcile the Montias data with their provenance and
                enrichments to their original source: the notarial acts. This reconciliation via the
                Golden Agents infrastructure is necessary because the Amsterdam City Archives due to
                their public mission only index person and geographical names, but not the art
                objects that Montias listed that we need as researchers.</p><p>We first link the
                inventories from the Getty Provenance Index and the Frick Collection to their
                corresponding notarial deeds. Additionally, we deduplicate the names indexed in
                these data sources and identify people utilizing the <rs ana="#Bib.Ref" key="Lenticular_Lenses_II">Lenticular Lenses II</rs> tool
                (Idrissou et al., 2018, 2019) in development within the Golden Agents project. Then
                we link the individual items indexed in the Montias database to the transcription of
                the historical archival source. The Web Annotation Model is used as a data model for
                the text and serves both modelling and presentational purposes. This allows us to
                link and to validate the exact piece of text indicated by coordinates on the scan
                where a certain object is listed and to present it for instance in a
                IIIF-environment. The thesauri AAT and TGN, [5] and ICONCLASS [6] help in describing
                these items in a standardized way. Finally, we demonstrate how, in line with the
                goals of the Golden Agents and the remodel of the Getty Provenance Index as Linked
                Open Data projects, [7] the results of the Montias Case can be relevant for data
                reconciliation and for modeling the provenance of distributed heterogeneous cultural
                heritage collections for (re-)use in digital humanities research projects in
                general.</p><p>[1] https://www.goldenagents.org</p><p>[2]
