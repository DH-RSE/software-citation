        <body>
            <p>More than the mere transposition of words from one language to another, the practice
                of translation is widely seen by scholars as an instance of cultural mediation and a
                force that contributes to shaping culture in various ways, as translators introduce
                new texts and ideas, adapting them to the target literary field.[1] Thus,
                translation sits at the intersection of cultures and of societies; no literature or
                culture exists in isolation, and the interaction between different literary systems
                is key to their evolution in time.[2]</p>
            <p>Although this appears as common sense, it is a fact rarely acknowledged in literary
                histories, which still focus for the most part on national or, at least,
                linguistically homogeneous units of analysis. Taking into account the international
                dimension of literature and culture fosters a better understanding of the processes
                of cultural change, as translation is instrumental in the import of new ways of both
                thinking about literature and writing.[3] This kind of approach is not uncommon in
                Translation Studies, however, it rarely focuses on mid to long-term patterns of
                change. Moreover, the underlying analysis is generally of a qualitative nature,
                focusing on literary agents and above all on the specific elements of repertoire
                that are being transferred and appropriated.[4] Indeed, textual analysis is an
                indispensable component of such a study, and it yields fundamental insight into the
                particulars of the process of cultural change. It is, however, not the only tool at
                our disposal.</p>
            <p>Based on a corpus of translated texts published in Mexican cultural periodicals from
                1894 to 1931, this paper assesses the contribution of quantitative methods to such
                an analysis. It stems from my doctoral research, which outlines the evolution of the
                functions and uses of translation in said corpus, seeking to examine Mexican
                literary history from a transnational perspective. More specifically, I argue that a
                data-driven approach can help identify broad trends in the production of
                translation, which can in turn help us substantiate or challenge conclusions drawn
                on the basis of particular case studies, and, as such, characterise cultural change
                over time.</p>
            <p>Periodical publications are fundamental for this kind of endeavour, as they are often
                considered as the most immediate format for intervention in public debate, including
                discussions around the concepts of literature and art.[5] The fact that the
                magazines contain competing aesthetics and ideologies make them an ideal source for
                the study of cultural change. This is currently being addressed in what might become
                a new subfield of Translation Studies, as attested by the recent special issue of
                Translation and Interpreting Studies titled “Translation and/in Periodical
                Publications” and the Translation in Periodical Publications Conference organised by
                the <rs type="software">MapModern</rs> project last year.[6] Various of the pieces
                presented in those instances contemplate diachronic evolutions (although not
                necessarily focusing on literary content), and some of them rely on a data-driven
                approach. However, this kind of research is very incipient, and we are still facing
                a lack of published studies on its methodological implications and possible
                results.</p>
            <p>In this context, I offer a comprehensive framework in which to approach literary
                translation published in periodicals, as well as a discussion of the usefulness of
                examining certain variables and challenges in doing so. This corresponds to the
                computational component of my doctoral research, which is nearing its completion. I
                believe that this kind of method can bring about important re-assessments and
                developments in literary history, especially in the Latin American context, in which
                these topics are hardly being addressed.</p>
            <p>The analysis itself consists of a variety of descriptive statistics run on a database
                which contains metadata for each of the translations published in a corpus of nearly
                20 magazines between 1894 and 1931. The variables include the issue in which each
                text was published, its date, title, author, translator, genre, original publication
                date, original language, as well as its length, starting page, and the format of its
                signature, in an effort to consider both the symbolic and material aspects of the
                publication of translations. Information about the authors and translators (such as
                their gender, nationality and dates of birth and death) are also recorded.</p>
            <p>These different variables allow us to explore a considerable amount of questions,
                among which I have chosen to focus on the evolution of the original language of
                translated texts, as well as their author’s nationality, and original date of
                publication in order to outline the cultural geography and temporality of each
                periodical. It is indeed telling what the cultural references are at a given moment
                in time, and their proximity or distance in time is an important factor when
                assessing the role of translation as a source of innovation. One of the most
                expected evolutions, to give just one example, is that of the balance between
                translations from French and English, which progressively shifts from the
                predominance of the former to the latter during the studied time period, in a
                process of increased hemispheric dialogue and cultural exchange. Of course, such
                conclusions can (and should) then be refined by considering other variables in
                conjunction (e.g. is this evolution shared by various literary genres or not, does
                it go hand in hand with a change in temporality or no, etc).</p>
            <p>In these different areas, my paper will emphasize the key role played by both data
                exploration and visualisation, and the usefulness of such an approach for literary
                history and Translation Studies alike.</p>
