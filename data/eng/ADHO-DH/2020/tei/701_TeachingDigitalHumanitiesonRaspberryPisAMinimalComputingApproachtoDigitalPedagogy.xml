            <p>As this year&apos;s conference theme suggests, Digital Humanities finds itself on the
                intersection between many different &quot;disciplines, methodologies, and
                pedagogies&quot; (Estill and Guiliano 2019). But while this intrinsic
                interdisciplinarity (see e.g. Klein 2015) can be regarded as one of the research
                field&apos;s chief assets, it quickly becomes a considerable hurdle in the
                classroom. As Ryan Cordell suggests, we tend to overestimate the technical skills of
                our ‘tech-savvy,’ ‘digital native’ students – and perhaps even the general affinity
                they have towards digital tools and methodologies (Cordell 2016, 465). Without a
                formalized technical or computational background, the skills our students  bring to
                the table rely heavily on their individual interests, experiences, and
                auto-didacticism. This situation culminates in a heterogenous classroom that makes
                it difficult to assess where the gaps in each of the students&apos; knowledge lie,
                and how they can be bridged. As such, the teacher&apos;s first task becomes to
                decide which basic skills the students will need for their digital research. As a
                result, technical DH courses often focus on teaching students specific skills that
                can be used in specific contexts to achieve specific research results, such as: How
                to use TEI-XML to encode a text-bearing object; How to use python to query a corpus
                of digital texts; How to use R to perform a stylometric analysis; How to use GIS
                frameworks to map data layers onto geographical zones; etc.</p>
            <p>As Mahony and Pierazzo argued in 2012, however, more than teaching such purely
                technical skills there is &quot;a need for teaching methodological approaches&quot;
                (215). Rather than teaching students to use new technologies, we need to teach them
                how those technologies work: how their methodological constraints affect our data;
                how they determine what we can and cannot do with our data; and how seemingly simple
                data processing steps imply &quot;interpretative decisions that change the nature of
                the data and how it can be validly interpreted&quot; (Melgar et al. 2019; see also
                van Zundert and Dekker 2017). Still the question remains: &quot;What are the right
                basic requirements&quot; for our students? (Scagliola et al. 2019) – Where do we
                start?</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a &apos;minimal digital pedagogy&apos; that applyies the
                principles of Minimal Computing in the classroom. As a working group of ADHO&apos;s
                GO:DH Special Interest Group, Minimal Computing sets out to rethink DH work for
                areas in the world where factors such as high-end hardware, software, network
                capacity, power, etc. are not a given, by performing our computational research
                &quot;under some set of significant constraints.&quot;[1] It is precisely such
                constraints, we believe, that allow us to get to the fundamentals of the
                technologies we are using – and to give our students a critical understanding of the
                tools they are using by building and configuring them from the ground up.</p>
            <p>This is the setup we have adopted for the Antwerp Summer School in DH[2] – an
                intensive one-week summer school that aims to teach students the basics of
                developing and hosting their own digital archives and editions. In the last two
                years, we have developed a tutorial for deploying a IIIF-compliant image server on a
                local network of Raspberry Pis (RPi). At the next iteration of the summer school, we
                want to take this setup one step further by teaching students how develop a
                full-fledged Digital Scholarly Edition based on those reproductions.[3]</p>
            <p>Much to our continued surprise, experience tells us that all of this is possible on a
                RPi. These affordable light-weight minicomputers the size of a credit card were
                originally designed to teach digital novices (especially children) computing and
                digital making skills, but have recently been successfully used in higher education
                classrooms as well (e.g. Zimmermann, Caballero Jr, and Brown 2017; Pasolini, Bazzi,
                and Zabini 2017). In our specific setup, students used RPis to up a Local Area
                Network where they installed, configured, and controlled web-based tools to host,
                share, and reuse digital reproductions of manuscripts with each other. This
                collaborative act of building a private network offered them a practical way to
                learn more about and play with fundamental computing concepts. In particular,
                through a series of tutorial instructions, integrated exercises, and group
                discussions, they were exposed to issues in physical computational and networking
                infrastructures; to working with unfamiliar operating systems; to operating a
                computer without an interface (command line); to communicating with and controlling
                other computers (SSH); to a number of data formats and markup languages (HTML, XML,
                CSS, JSON, Pyramid TIFF, etc.); and – crucially – they learned to approach important
                technological standards and complex digital frameworks (such as IIIF) from a
                developer’s perspective rather than from a user’s.</p>
            <p>But alongside the advantages of learning-by-building (Clement 2012; Ramsay and
                Rockwell 2012) and its applicability to a range of DH technologies, adopting a
                minimal computing approach to DH pedagogy has other benefits as well. To start, the
                setup is cost efficient: it requires no proprietary software, and can be run
                quasi-independently of the host institution’s technical infrastructure. A such, the
                minimal set of hardware for this course requires a onetime investment of around
                $1,500 – or less than a single up-to-date desktop computer. What is more, if the
                host institution provides an internet connection without AP isolation and
                participants bring their own laptops, the entire hardware setup for a course with up
                to 30 participants may even fit into a standard-sized carry-on trolley. And for
                students without personal computers, minor adaptations to the tutorial could be
                considered to provide a similar learning experience. Finally, since our current
                setup only uses the internet to update and download free Linux packages (which might
                be provided via a local repository within the RPi network), it may even be possible
                to teach this course without an internet connection. As such, this portable and
                independent setup would allow us to teach DH in areas with limited access to digital
                infrastructures – a setup that we hope to try out at a collaborating university in
                the Philippines.</p>
