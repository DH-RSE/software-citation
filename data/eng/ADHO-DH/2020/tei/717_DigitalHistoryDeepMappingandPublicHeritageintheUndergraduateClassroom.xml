            <p>Can new methods of digital humanities and collaborative public history foster an
                appreciation of the diversity of experiences of space and place through time and
                across cultures? This paper presents a case study of a recent undergraduate seminar
                that sought answers to this question through a deep mapping of the long history of
                Northfield, MN, before and after its most well-known era of late nineteenth-century
                European settlement. Students were introduced to digital mapping technologies
                including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), web mapping frameworks, 3D modeling,
                and video game engines, which they used to map the long history of the region from
                geological time through its historical origins as part of the Dakota homelands, to
                its recent past and present as a region of increasingly diverse immigrants. The
                results (while still a work in progress) prove that digital deep mapping methods are
                particularly well suited for sharing human-centered stories grounded in land, region
                and community.  </p>
            <p>Deep mapping is as much archaeology as it is cartography, plumbing the depths of a
                particular place to explore its diversity through time.[1] The term was coined by
                William Least Heat­-Moon, whose book PrairyErth set the standard as a richly
                layered, historical and literary study of the land and peoples of Chase County,
                Kansas.[2] “Deep mapping” has since been taken up by the digital and spatial
                humanities communities to explore how issues like time depth, multivocality, and
                uncertainty — notoriously hard to represent in traditional printed maps — can be
                visualized using today’s digital mapping and interactive programming
                techniques.[3]</p>

                elements</p>
            <p>Over the course of 10 weeks, the students and I collaboratively built a “deep map”
                website that tells a series of spatial stories, built in numerous platforms and
                organized geographically, but linked together through modern web development
                tools.[4] Inspired by PrairyErth, our goal was to construct a deep map that
                &quot;encompasses a range of approaches—cartographic, geographical, historical,
                literary, philosophical, scientific, anthropological, sociological and
                theological—to weave multiple strands of evidence, observation, impression and
                memory into a distillation of place.&quot;[5] Least Heat-Moon organized his book
                (somewhat arbitrarily) by US Geological Survey quadrangles, further dividing those
                sections into chapters that focus on one physical or thematic aspect of the
                territory. Our website would do the same, with sections devoted to each quadrangle
                surrounding Northfield MN and 3-5 sub-pages narrating and illustrating distinct
                aspects of that quadrangle&apos;s spatial history.</p>
            <p>Figure 2: Primary navigation of the website is via USGS Quadrangle maps</p>
            <p>The key innovations of our remix of PrairyErth’s main elements were: 1)
                multivocality, allowing numerous authors to deepen each other’s insights, and 2)
                leveraging digital mapping technologies to make these &quot;chapters&quot;
                interactive and publicly accessible through the internet. ESRI StoryMaps narrate the
                fraught migrations in the region, from ancestral Dakota peoples, to Czech and
                Norwegian immigrants, to the current increase in Somali and other West African
                populations. 3D GIS scenes and embedded <rs type="software">Unity</rs> games allow
                surrogate experiences of movement through the landscape, while custom scripts
                juxtapose individual maps with quotations from our collective Common Place Book (a
                concept again borrowed and digitally updated from Least Heat-Moon). </p>

            <p>The aim of this paper is to share our experiences and open a dialogue about deep
                mapping as a method for collaborative public scholarship that can connect engaged
                undergraduate learning with the needs of community partners while staying firmly
                grounded in place.[6]</p>
