            <p>Abstract</p>
            <p>Discoverability and sustainability bedevil DH projects. They suffer from problems of
                sustainability not just through obsolescence of technology, but by lack of
                discoverability and use&#8212;sustainability is not just a technological problem but
                also a social one. The Making and Knowing Project&#8217;s development of a Community
                Crossroads confronts these issues by fostering a collaborative culture in humanities
                research through digital tools to share not only data and finished products, but
                also insights into the work behind the scenes, and the integration of research and
                pedagogy. We question what it means for a scholarly digital product to be
                &#8220;final,&#8221; and we broaden the concept of digital sustainability to include
                not just the technical sense of static data storage, but also a social environment
                of continued user involvement and dynamic project development. By addressing
                discoverability, sustainability, and use, the panel responds to the DH2020 themes of
                the public digital humanities and open data.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>The Making and Knowing Project (M&amp;K)</p>
            <p>Since 2014, M&amp;K has studied the intersections of craft making and scientific
                knowing in the early modern period through the lens of BnF Ms. Fr. 640&#8212;a
                little-known compilation in Middle French by an anonymous
                &#8220;author-practitioner&#8221; of roughly 1,000 &#8220;recipes&#8221; detailing
                instructions for artistic and technological objects. The manuscript grants insights
                into the process by which artistic creation yielded insights into the workings of
                nature. It is a rich and unique example of a &#8220;how-to&#8221; text&#8212;a body
                of literature whose significance is widely acknowledged, but under-investigated.
                Over the last 6 years, through crowd- and grad-sourcing in workshops, conferences,
                and courses, M&amp;K has transcribed, translated, encoded, researched, and annotated
                the 340-page manuscript. In February 2020, it released a digital critical edition of
                the entire manuscript: Making and Knowing Project, Pamela H. Smith, Naomi
                Rosenkranz, Tianna Helena Uchacz, Tillmann Taape, Cl&#233;ment Godbarge, Sophie
                Pitman, Jenny Boulboull&#233;, Joel Klein, Donna Bilak, Marc Smith, and Terry
                Catapano, eds., Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France. A Digital
                Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 (New York: Making and
                Knowing Project, 2020), https://edition640.makingandknowing.org. M&amp;K will now
                transform its static Edition into the core of a dynamic Community Crossroads.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>Product vs. Process</p>
            <p>Despite being defined as modes of scholarship, the digital humanities are often
                solely represented by products rather than the methodologies employed in their
                creation; once the collaborative work ceases, the experiential insights are effaced
                in the finished project and lost to makers of future projects. While the digital
                humanities offer new modes of dissemination and sustainability of scholarly
                products, they also provide opportunities for evaluating, refining, and sharing the
                research process. &#8220;Product&#8221; also characterizes the scholarly format of a
                critical edition, which is intended as a definitive version of a manuscript or
                manuscript corpus. This focus on definitive product works at cross-purposes to one
                of the greatest potentials of the digital humanities: user-directed, open-ended
                interactivity that allows scholarship to be built upon and broken down, with the
                data, platform, and methods reused and reassembled by reader-users in new and
                inventive ways.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>A recognition of the tension between the Project&#8217;s aim of the definitive
                critical edition product of Ms. Fr. 640 and the digital humanities process we
                employed came to a head as students sought to reconstruct the technical
                &#8220;recipes&#8221; of the manuscript in a laboratory course, and we came to see
                that a recipe text is, by its nature, not a definitive text&#8212;its processes can
                never be fully realized in writing, and they are often much harder to comprehend in
                words than by doing (or by watching, as YouTube has demonstrated), thus extension
                into the physical and digital realm was necessary. Moreover, Ms. Fr. 640 is a
                compiled text, and it can be broken down and rearranged in any number of ways, thus
                forming an ideal text for the reassemblage and reuse that digital format makes
                possible. The Project aims to foster new uses and new interpretations of this
                assemblage of recipes through making its components available in a Community
                Crossroads.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>The Community Crossroads </p>
            <p>A series of workshops and courses focusing on pedagogy, research, and outreach will
                create a community of reader-users of the Edition who take away the Project&#8217;s
                teaching resources, the digital infrastructure for its Edition, and its methods and
                process, to reuse and reassemble in their own diverse settings&#8212;whether digital
                humanities labs, classrooms, museums, or public programs. Fostering the community,
                and the new and anticipated uses and discoveries it will engender, will extend and
                sustain&#8212;in the fullest sense of the word&#8212;the Edition. The
                Edition&#8217;s methods and process, hidden by its format as a critical edition,
                will be made visible and disseminated. The Community Crossroads comprises three main
                components:</p>
            <p>? The M&amp;K &#8220;Research and Teaching Companion&#8221; will refine and extend
                the methodologies developed through the creation of its Edition of Fr. 640 and
                articulate them in a formal implementation guide. The web-based Companion will offer
                a flexible and adaptable model with resources that scholars, instructors, and
                students can employ in their own research endeavors or in the classroom. It forms a
                scalable template for applying and transferring the Project&#8217;s key methods:
                interdisciplinarity and collaboration; pedagogy-driven research and research-driven
                pedagogy; material literacy through historical reconstructions of past techniques;
                and the harnessing and utilization of the digital humanities to serve research
                questions.</p>
            <p>? The &#8220;myEdition&#8221; community version will make available an open-source,
                customizable version of the Edition infrastructure, releasing a community software
                platform in which others can create their own digital critical editions, using the
                Project&#8217;s framework to work with their own data.</p>
            <p>? The &#8220;Sandbox Space&#8221; will be an interactive online environment for
                others to 1) explore and experiment with the Project&#8217;s data using a variety of
                digital tools, and 2) add and create their own tools, case studies, and resources
                resulting from the use of the Template components.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>The Community Crossroads thus aims to overcome and rethink the most serious
                challenges in digital humanities projects&#8212; discoverability, sustainability,
                and the effacing of the creation process.</p>

            <p>TITLE: Insights from the Making of a Digital EditionABSTRACT: The Making and Knowing
                Project&#8217;s five-year initiative to transcribe, translate, and encode the text
                of BnF Ms. Fr. 640, a sixteenth-century how-to text with almost 1000 entries for a
                diverse range of art and technical processes, has yielded evidence about the
                relationship between craft and science in early modern Europe. It has also provided
                insights about methodology in collaborative work across humanistic studies, the
                value of integrating hands-on materials-based and digital learning into curricula,
                and the viability of a model of pedagogy-driven lab-based research outside of the
                hard sciences.</p>

            <p>TITLE: A Case Study in Developing Responsive, Functional Design within Minimal
                Computing Constraints</p>
            <p>ABSTRACT: To ensure its archival preservation by Columbia University Libraries, the
                Making and Knowing Project required that its Digital Critical Edition be developed
                as a static site while meeting certain core expectations for functionality. This
                presented several design challenges for Performant Software, including the need for
                a responsive layout to reconstruct the text and marginalia of the original folio,
                the adaptation of Lunr&#8217;s basic functionality to generate satisfying searches
                of middle French transcriptions and contemporary English translation, and the
                leveraging of the Project&#8217;s custom semantic markup toward a meaningful
                navigation tool.</p>

            <p>TITLE: Social and Technical Strategies for Sustainability </p>
            <p>ABSTRACT: The Making and Knowing Project&#8217;s Edition, conceived within
                Columbia&#8217;s ethic of minimal computing, has approached sustainability from two
                directions: technical and social. While the former led to the development of a
                reduced-functionality, &#8220;small-stack&#8221; website to minimize dependencies
                and avoid rapid obsolescence, the latter has mitigated some of the technical
                limitations by fostering a &#8220;Community Crossroads&#8221; where public users can
                interact with the Project&#8217;s core data along designated pathways through
                alternative interfaces (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) or independently through full data
                downloads to which users can bring their own tools, as well as submission of change
                suggestions, analyses, and limited-support projects. Among the latter are a suite of
                augmented reality tools to visualize the Project data, co-developed by
                Columbia&#8217;s Computer Graphic and User Interfaces Lab. At the heart of this
                Community Crossroads lies Performant Software&#8217;s release of a community version
                of the edition software for adaptation to new texts and projects.</p>

            <p>TITLE: Collaborative Digital Humanities Teaching as a Research Method: A Case Study
                toward a Research and Teaching Companion</p>
            <p>ABSTRACT: The Making and Knowing Project practices pedagogy-driven research&#8212;a
                method in which students with no necessary prior training undertake intensive
                skill-building and then consolidate their newly won competencies through credited
                work on research tasks and problem-based projects that advance the Project&#8217;s
                overall research goals. Two new DH graduate seminars at Columbia, co-designed and
                collaboratively taught in 2017 and 2019, yielded edition prototypes and exploratory
                textual analyses that proved instrumental in the development of the Project&#8217;s
                Digital Critical Edition. This talk presents insights from the design and outcomes
                of these seminars&#8212;insights which stand as one component part of the
                Project&#8217;s Research and Teaching Companion (full release expected July 2021),
                which will offer a formal articulation of the Project&#8217;s principles and methods
                of pedagogy-driven research as well as a resource set for other scholars,
                instructors, and practitioners to scale and adapt to their own particular needs.</p>

            <p>TITLE: How to Transcribe and Translate an Early Modern How-to Text (and how not
                to)</p>
            <p>ABSTRACT: This paper reviews the textual scholarship principles, pedagogical
                strategies, and platform decisions behind the Making and Knowing Project&#8217;s
                five-year, workshop-based effort to transcribe, translate, and encode BnF Ms. Fr.
                640, an eclectic collection of practical knowledge in sixteenth-century French whose
                prose is idiosyncratic, highly technical, and heterogeneous, ranging from terse to
                rambling. The collaborative and iterative nature of the undertaking, as well as the
                deliberate entwining of the text-based work with hands-on historical reconstruction
                of materials and techniques in the laboratory, led to an evolution of the aims and
                strategies of our transcriptions and translation over time, with implications for
                workflow from workshop to workshop and for the eventual presentation of the text in
                the Edition.</p>

            <p>TITLE: Le mille-feuille &#233;ditorial et ses ramifications th&#233;oriques</p>
            <p>ABSTRACT: L&#8217;&#233;dition critique num&#233;rique du BnF Ms. Fr. 640 offre aux
                lecteurs pas moins de cinq versions diff&#233;rentes du texte: le fac-simil&#233;
                (en mode image), la transcription diplomatique (xml), la transcription
                normalis&#233;e (xml), une traduction anglaise (xml) ainsi que le rendu final de ces
                textes sur &#233;cran (html/css). Cette prolif&#233;ration de couches offre de
                nombreux avantages. Elle permet aux &#233;ditions critiques de s&#8217;ouvrir &#224;
                de nouveaux publics tout en invitant le lecteur &#224; explorer les diff&#233;rentes
                &#233;tapes du processus &#233;ditorial et de se familiariser avec la source
                premi&#232;re. Elle rend aussi l&#8217;&#233;dition plus ouverte et extensible,
                facilitant &#224; l&#8217;avenir la superposition de couches suppl&#233;mentaires,
                comme de nouvelles variantes ou traductions du texte. Cette prolif&#233;ration de
                couches, cependant, soul&#232;ve un certain nombre de questions, li&#233;es
                notamment aux cons&#233;quences de cette complexification. En effet, comment
                additionner les couches sans nuire &#224; la coh&#233;rence de notre &#233;dition?
                Quelle place donner au choix &#233;ditorial dans un mod&#232;le qui en favorise la
                dilution?</p>
