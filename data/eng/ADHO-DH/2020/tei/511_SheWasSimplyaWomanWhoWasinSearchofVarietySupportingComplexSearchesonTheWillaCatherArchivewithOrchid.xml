            <p>"She Was Simply a Woman Who Was In Search of Variety"</p>
            <p>Supporting Complex Searches on The Willa Cather Archive with Orchid</p>
            <p>Dussault, Jessica; Tunink, Greg; Dalziel, Karin</p>
            <p>University of Nebraska-Lincoln</p>
            <p>The Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH)1 is developing the
                open-source software, Orchid, to provide a browsing, searching, and viewing
                interface for documents stored in a center-wide API.2 Orchid was built not only to
                accommodate new projects at the CDRH, but also as a tool to allow rapid upgrading of
                older sites using TEI-XML3 documents as part of a mission to address the technical
                debt of dozens of aging sites. In late 2018, the first production site powered by
                Orchid, The Complete Letters of Willa Cather,4 was launched as a complement to the
                existing Willa Cather Archive (WCA) website.5 While The Complete Letters was now
                powered by Orchid, the rest of the WCA remained in Apache Cocoon,6 a framework it
                had used since the mid-2000s. In 2019, the CDRH challenged itself with migrating the
                entire WCA to an Orchid-powered application &#8212; a strong proof-of-concept that
                Orchid was equally suited to the task of hosting complex existing projects as well
                as new sites.</p>
            <p>The first obstacle to migrating the WCA site was that Orchid had not been built for
                the complexity of sites such as the WCA. The site draws from overlapping sets of
                documents with differing displays and behavior, so the new application required both
                a site-wide search in addition to the existing Complete Letters search
                functionality. In order to address this challenge, Orchid logic was altered to
                support multiple sections of websites with customizable browsing options, search
                defaults, interfaces, and internationalization.7 This was engineered to re-use as
                much of the existing Orchid code and require as little additional configuration and
                code in the application as possible.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>Figure 1: Screenshots of the site-wide WCA search (left) and The Complete Letters
                search (right). Differences include the ability to search annotations separately,
                different filters, a custom display, and a search by letter identifier.</p>
            <p>This multi-section functionality is predicted to be utilized by complex sites slated
                for upgrade from older technologies, such as The Walt Whitman Archive.8 Perhaps most
                exciting of all, the multi-section functionality of Orchid brings us closer to a
                long-term goal of the CDRH to offer simple interfaces for engaging with older
                documents from dozens of projects available as sub-sites in a single, centralized
                application.</p>
