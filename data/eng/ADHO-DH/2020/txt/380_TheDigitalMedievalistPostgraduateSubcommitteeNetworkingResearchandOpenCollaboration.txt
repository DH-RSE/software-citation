Digital Medievalist (digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com) is an international, interest-based virtual research community with a broad thematic focus that brings together academics and social scientists of varying status and promotes ways to jointly expand the scope of the individual disciplines under the umbrella of "medieval studies". During the poster session we would like to introduce the various initiatives of the Digital Medievalist Community and promote networking within the DH community. In particular, the presentation will outline the planned activities of the newly-founded Postgraduate Subcommittee - organization of joint panels, production of podcasts, general social media presence - and promote a peer-to-peer exchange.
