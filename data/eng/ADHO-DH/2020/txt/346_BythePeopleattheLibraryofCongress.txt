In October 2018 the Library of Congress launched By the People (https://crowd.loc.gov/), a text transcription and tagging crowdsourcing project powered by a new platform called Concordia. Concordia was developed at the Library to accommodate the particular needs of the Libraryâ€™s infrastructure and legacy data management systems. This poster will focus on the data lifecyle of By the People transcriptions, and offer a possible model for practitioners at other institutions.
