This paper studies how a work becomes canonical in early modern Britain. It is based on an extensive project on bibliographic records, and, the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC) in particular. We study different features of canonical works in detail. We aim to find relevant factors that canonical works have in common and examine the different paths works take in becoming a part of public consciousness.
