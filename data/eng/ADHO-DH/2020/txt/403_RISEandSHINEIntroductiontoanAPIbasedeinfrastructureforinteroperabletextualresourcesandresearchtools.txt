Textual resources still overwhelmingly exist in digital silos with limited interoperability amongst themselves and to digital research tools. Some large-scale infrastructural projects are intended to address this issue by centralizing resources, while others focus on promoting interoperable standards for exchange of textual resources. In this four-hour workshop, we will present our modular and decentralized solution to these issues: RISE and SHINE. We will have hands-on sessions on how to make use of our technical products with two primary target groups: research tool developers who would like to learn how to make RISE-linked texts available in their tools, as well as resource owners who would like to learn how to make their texts discoverable in a SHINE-compatible format.
