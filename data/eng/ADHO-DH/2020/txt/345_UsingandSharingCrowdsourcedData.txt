Crowdsourcing projects are proliferating in the humanities and gallery, library, archive and museum (GLAM) world. These projects often produce complex datasets that provide new challenges and opportunities for practitioners across many disciplines. We need to have more conversations about how best to use and share this data, and to be open about the failures, as well as the successes of our crowdsourcing project designs and methodologies. This forum will speak directly to two of the conference themes this year: Digital Public Humanities and open data.
