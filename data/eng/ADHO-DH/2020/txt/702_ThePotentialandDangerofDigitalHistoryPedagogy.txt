This presentation draws on a corpus of digital history syllabi from both the United States and Canada to explore the tensions between these varied uses and characterizations of digital history. It employs close readings of digital history syllabi alongside network analyses of co-assigned readings. The combination of these methods allows for a deep exploration the ways in which digital history is increasingly being used to challenge traditional power structures; to make space for students who are often marginalized within the academy; to share historical narratives beyond conventional audiences; while also deploying history in service of capital-enhancing activities and magnifying the voices of already dominant scholars; and dampening the voices of marginalized scholars.
