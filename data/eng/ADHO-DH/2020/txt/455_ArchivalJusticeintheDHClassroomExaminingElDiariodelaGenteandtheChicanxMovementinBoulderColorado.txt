This presentation addresses the role that archival justice can play in the digital humanities classroom, as a means to not only enable exploration of methodological approaches in DH, from text mining and geospatial analysis, but also to address the disciplinary decorum of DH. In particular, archival justice centralizes postcolonial and feminist approaches to DH pedagogy and research, while playing a vital role in unearthing silenced histories. The author will share the pedagogical considerations and challenges of this approach to teaching a graduate-level DH course through analysing the independent Chicanx student newspaper, El Diario de la Gente, which was published 1972-1983 at the University of Colorado Boulder. The presentation will also highlight students' final projects that resulted from the class.
