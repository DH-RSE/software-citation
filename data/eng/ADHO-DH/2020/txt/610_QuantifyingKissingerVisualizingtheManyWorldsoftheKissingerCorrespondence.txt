This presentation will detail the latest from this Fortier Prize-winning doctoral dissertation, now nearing completion at the CUNY Graduate Center. The paper will present a brief history of the project's origins in foreign relations study, public history and archival research and detail its varying use of textual and network analysis, data visualization, narrative storytelling and, most recently, virtual and augmented reality.
