This poster will highlight some of the challenges of teaching introductory-level digital humanities courses in undergraduate and graduate classrooms, and will describe pedagogical solutions developed by faculty at UCLA and the University of Washington to address these problems. These include identifying and developing the core skill sets students need to begin work in digital humanities, such as best practices for project management, working with data and interpreting and presenting analyses. From a faculty standpoint, the poster will suggest strategies for building collaborative partnerships between libraries and faculty to best leverage each respective groupâ€™s expertise.
