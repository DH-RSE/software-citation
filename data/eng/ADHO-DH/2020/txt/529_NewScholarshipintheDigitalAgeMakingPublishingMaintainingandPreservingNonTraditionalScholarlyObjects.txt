We discuss the myriad ways digital scholarship is being conceived, produced, distributed, and preserved in the digital humanities. This short paper is based on the results of an 18-month A.W. Mellon-funded project called Digits: A Platform to Facilitate the Production of Digital Scholarship, in which we interviewed 75 subjects involved in the creation, publication, maintenance, and preservation of Non-Traditional Scholarly Objects (NTSOs). We further studied containerization and other possible sociotechnical interventions suggested in secondary literature, which might reduce points of friction around NTSOs.
