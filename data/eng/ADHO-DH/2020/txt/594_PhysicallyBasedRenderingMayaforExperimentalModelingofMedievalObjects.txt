This presentation demonstrates the value of the 3d graphics program Maya for modeling medieval manuscripts and other historic objects. Mayaâ€™s physically-based rendering allows the creation of models that take into account the materials and finishes of objects. Objects can be animated or placed into environments that include varied lighting sources and other objects, allowing experimentation with different historical conditions of viewing.
The presentation includes a specific case study of this approach for a gilded early medieval gospel book, and also addresses the early stages of using Maya for modeling medieval textiles and liturgical objects.
Finally, I address the potential to share artifact models among different audiences and researchers, allowing users to combine and compare models within larger environments.
