This presentation aims to share results from a data-driven approach for exploring Lusophobia and desidentificação (disidentification) in nineteenth- and twentieth- century Brazil. Combining qualitative data analysis and statistical approaches, we identified 169 Portuguese characters from a sample of 51 Brazilian books of the ~800 published during that time. In examining the characters and nuances of desidentificação, we interrogated 1) whether characters were represented positively neutrally, negatively or ironically; 2) whether their gender and occupation played a role in that representation, and 3) how portrayals of Portuguese migrants changed over time.
