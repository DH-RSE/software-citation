Poetic traditions across languages evolved differently, but we find that certain semantic topics occur in several of them, albeit sometimes with temporal delay, or with diverging trajectories over time. We apply Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to poetry corpora of four languages, i.e. German (52k poems), English (85k poems), Russian (18k poems), and Czech (80k poems). We try to align and interpret salient topics and their trend over time (1600â€“1925 A.D.), showing similarities and disparities across poetic traditions with a few select topics, and use the trajectories of topics over time to pinpoint specific literary epochs.
