My presentation focuses on the redesigning of classroom activities in undergraduate learning for Chinese history; it does so by examining and reflecting on the effectiveness of the in-class activities and assignments that I have devised and adopted for relevant courses. These include online annotation exercises of Classical Chinese texts with Hypothesis and CTEXT, extraction of biographical entries from the China Biographical Database, mapping exercises on WorldMap, and digital metrical analysis of classical poetry on the Souyun platform.
This study is funded by the University Grants Committee of Hong Kong's Teaching and Development Grants through a Teaching Start-Up Grant at the City University of Hong Kong: “Rediscovering Chinese History through Data: Incorporating Digital Humanities Pedagogy into Data-Driven Learning of Chinese History” (Project No.: 6000707).
