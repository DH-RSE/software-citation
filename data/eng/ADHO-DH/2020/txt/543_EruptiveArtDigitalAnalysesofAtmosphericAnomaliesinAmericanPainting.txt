This paper focuses on the reconstruction of the geographical extension of atmospheric anomalies after volcanic eruptions across the United States as well as their influence on artistic productions during the 19th century. Methodically, I work at the intersection between classical art historical approaches and digital humanities, using computational tools that help analyze and evaluate the extensive image corpus of my study.
