TEI-XML is the standard in digital text editing. The classic inline annotation with TEI quickly reaches its limits when it comes to complex annotations. In order to realize DH projects with such requirements on the dhPLUS platform currently developed at the University of Salzburg, a special form of stand-off markup is presented: It saves the original TEI file, converts the markup into RDF instructions, keeps the text and links the triples to an unlimited number of annotation levels. A unique identifier connects the different stages and facilitates presentation and search processes.
