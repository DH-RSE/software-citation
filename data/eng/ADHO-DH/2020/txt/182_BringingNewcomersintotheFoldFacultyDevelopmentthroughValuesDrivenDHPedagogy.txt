A pervasive goal of DH is to bring new and curious faculty into the fold in a sustained way. At Michigan State University, we have developed a highly successful DH Pedagogy Learning Community to help new-to-DH instructors effectively integrate DH into their courses. Key to faculty engagement was our focus on how DH values such as collaboration, community, inclusion, public humanities, and experimentation aligned with their own priorities in teaching. We are now launching an OER that includes the curriculum for this values-driven learning community that can be used by either individual instructors or anyone wishing to lead their own discipline-agnostic learning community for new-to-DH faculty.
