The process for automatically creating 3D city models from contemporary photographs and visualizing them on mobile devices is now well established, but historical 4D city models are more challenging. The fourth dimension here is time. This contribution describes an automated VR pipeline based on historical photographs and resulting in an interactive browser-based device-rendered 4D visualization and information system for mobile devices. Since the pipeline shown is currently still under development, initial results for stages of the process will be shown and assessed for feasibility.
