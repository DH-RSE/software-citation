Understanding users’ online behaviour is of growing interest to academic researchers in a variety of fields. Traditionally, in the marketing domain commercial research companies map consumer behaviour to understand when and where customers decide to buy products. For this purpose, web metrics of individual websites serve as detailed source of information on when, how and at which section a user enters a website. Recently this type of data is also being used by cultural heritage institutes to understand the interest of their visitors (De Haan and Adolfsen, 2008), to track where their digital content is being reused (Navarrete Hernández, 2014) or to understand the query’s users perform in search systems by analysing the log files (Batista and Silva, 2002; Huurnink, 2010). In this type of research, the website is the central research object providing traces that Menchen-Trevino (2013) calls ‘Horizontal Data sets’. These contain data that are ‘organized around a specific type of trace, for example search terms, web browsing log files, tweets, hashtags, likes or friend and follower ties’ (Menchen-Trevino, 2013: 331). An advantage of using this type of data is that they are not obtrusive to the respondents since they are created automatically as users are surfing the web. However, this also leads to an ethical disadvantage since users are not aware that their online behaviour is being examined, nor could they give their consent to have their data being analysed. While Horizontal Data Sets are organized around one type of trace, Vertical Data Sets are organized around research participants that deliberately ‘give permission for researchers to collect their digital traces’ (Menchen-Trevino, 2013: 331).
Since mid-1990s, commercial research agencies have started to collect these types of vertical data by building tools and panels of respondents whose online behaviour is monitored 24/7 to provide data on usage across media and purchase behaviour (Coffey, 2001; Napoli, 2010; Taneja and Mamoria, 2012). Similar to television viewing rates, these lists are mainly created to gain more insight in the background of website visitors in order to provide potential advertisers with information on how to reach their online target audience in the best possible manner. Obviously these commercial research data contain very rich information, also for academics who are interested in collecting real-world Web use data. However, apart from lists of the most popular domains that are published as open data by companies such as Alexa and Similarweb
http://www.alexa.com/topsites
,
http://www.similarweb.com/global
, data containing information about visits to each individual page and information about the background of the panel is not available. Main arguments of commercial agencies to not collaborate with scholars is to ensure the confidentiality of their respondents’ identity and to prevent scholars to gain insight into the techniques applied by the companies.
Nevertheless, researchers in a variety of disciplines are interested in tracking online behaviour in a real-world situation. Especially in the communications science realm, scholars experimented with several techniques of tracking people’s online behaviour (Ebersole, 2000; Tewksbury, 2003; Findahl et al., 2013; Findahl, 2009; Munson et al., 2013; Damme et al., 2015; Menchen-Trevino and Karr, 2012). Striking about these pioneering monitoring studies is its multi-method approach. By default each does not only monitor web use but also compares its outcome with either survey, diary or interview data. By triangulating the results, these researchers try to overcome the critique on classic studies on media consumption that often deploy either surveys or diaries registering self-reported media behaviour (e.g. Van Cauwenberge, d’Haenens and Beentjes, 2010; Schrøder and Kobbernagel, 2010; Taneja et al., 2012; Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, 2015). These methods strongly rely on the memory of the participants while several scholars found respondents often overestimate their media use (Ebersole, 2000; Prior, 2009; Robinson, 1985). Furthermore, since filling in diaries and surveys on news consumption is very labour-intensive, its outcomes mainly focus on
when
media have been consumed or on
which
devices, while it remains unclear
what
has been consumed. One way to gain insight in the consumed news content is focus on metrics of individual news organisations (Batista and Silva, 2002; Boczkowski et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Usher, 2013) or the most clicked items (e.g. Boczkowski et al., 2011; Karlsson and Clerwall, 2013; Lee et al., 2012; Nederlandse Nieuwsmonitor, 2013). However, given the focus of these studies on individual websites or most-clicked articles it remains unknown which genres of news websites constitute users’ 24/7 news menu. Do they e.g. visit news about sports mainly in the morning and news on politics mainly during the evening? Taneja at el. (2012) tried to overcome this problem by literally following 495 users throughout an entire day. However, even with this labour-intensive fieldwork it proved not to be possible to incorporate the genres of consumed news items.
Web monitoring tools such as the above mentioned examples, now offer a less labour-intensive and more precise way of registering digitally consumed news items. By deploying these techniques, we could overcome the knowledge gap of the 24/7 news consumption menu. Therefore, we created
the Newstracker
, a custom built system that collects web activities of specified and authenticated users, cleans the data by removing non-relevant data, extracts the associated content and stores this as a new dataset to be used for analysis. While most existing online tracking studies mainly report the visited websites, our set-up goes two steps further. We did not only monitor the website titles but also the actual visited URLs and crawled all textual and visual contents of the visited websites. Since one of the problems when monitoring a person’s online behaviour is the magnitude of the data that is being collected (Batista and Silva, 2002; Manovich, 2012; Vicente-Marino, 2013: 43), we deployed automated content analyses techniques (Atteveldt, 2008; et al., 2012) to detect the topics that are being discussed in the news items. This enabled us to calculate the topical online news consumption during the day.
In this paper we will describe the set-up of ‘The Newstracker’ in a study on the online news consumption of a group of young Dutch news users and its applicability for other types of Digital Humanities research such as user studies focussing on formulating requirements based on existing user behaviour. We will demonstrate the workflow of the Newstracker and how we designed the data collection and pre-processing phase (see figure 1).
Figure 1. Workflow of the Newstracker application, illustrating the two main phases: Data Collection and Pre-processing. The latter consists of three stages: cleaning, content extraction and merging
By reflecting on the technical, methodological and analytical challenges we encountered, we will illustrate the potential of online monitoring tools such as the Newstracker. We will end our paper with discussing its limitations by stressing the need for a multimethod study design when aiming not only to register but also to understand online user behaviour.
