Academic intrigue has the potential to provide emancipatory power to disenfranchised communities by granting a voice to those who havenâ€™t been heard. In this project we aim to lift the voices of the people in Puerto Rico who were ignored after the passage of Hurricane Maria. We will do this by using qualitative methods from the field of Rhetoric and quantitative methods from the field of Digital Humanities to map out how people remember life during and post Maria on the island based on their descriptions and proximity to the event.
