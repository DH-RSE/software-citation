DUCAT is a tool that uses the CITE Architecture, allowing alignments among texts. It is a zero-infrastructure HTML app that exports data in a plain-text CEX format. It allows two kinds of alignments among any number of texts, in any language:
**Citation Alignment** A poem, cited line-by-line, is translated into prose, cited by paragraph. A paragraph of the translation might correspond to several lines of poetry; a range of lines of poetry might overlap with seveal paragraphs of the prose translation.
**Translation Alignment** A text and its translation will not align word-by-word, but will inevitably consist of one-to-one, one-to-zero, many-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, many-to-zero, or zero-to-many alignments. In the case of "many" the words may be discontiguous. When we align more than one translation with an original text, these problems multiply.
While DUCAT is a standalone tool, the data it produces is generic, plain-text, and can be re-imported, shared, and reused.
