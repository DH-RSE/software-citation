Digital humanities are rich with publications, workshops, guides, and resource lists that introduce the field’s concepts and methods. As digital humanities have grown, trainings and materials for experienced practitioners have become prominent. Yet, as the authors have observed through their involvement with the National Humanities Center’s Summer Institute on Objects, Places, and the Digital Humanities, needs remain for resources that introduce anyone interested in creating a dh project to core methodological considerations and knowledge necessary to productively choose platforms and approaches that fit their research goals. This gap is especially apparent in fields dealing with visual materials and physical spaces, such as digital art history, where infrastructure for visual technologies varies. Visualizing Objects, Places, and Spaces: A Digital Project Handbook (https://handbook.pubpub.org) is designed to address that gap. This poster outlines the Handbook’s structure, reflects on the project’s own development process, and shares next steps.
