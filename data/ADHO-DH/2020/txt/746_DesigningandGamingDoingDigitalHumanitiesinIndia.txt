The panel will discuss a ‘meta-understanding’ of gaming culture and design ethos within postcolonial contexts and spaces. This panel will discuss specific DH projects especially in the areas of Gaming and Design to offer varied perspectives and possibilities as well as challenge how such (existing) epistemes and practices are conceived and mediated by the Global North. The three papers in this panel together situate these emerging DH practices and projects as complex rhizomatic activities whose theorizations and logic are yet to be narrated or articulated with any cohesiveness, primarily due to tactical reasons: which allow for a dispersed examination of gaming and design cultures in the heterogenous (neoliberal) settings of India. Secondly, they also offer us insight into how these inherently technological activities are re-shaped and remediated by the users thus forcing academics and researchers to develop new ways of understanding of these artifacts.
