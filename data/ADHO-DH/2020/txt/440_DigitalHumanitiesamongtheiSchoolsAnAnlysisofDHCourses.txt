This poster presents an analysis of current DH courses at the iSchools, an international group of 106 schools, colleges, and departments that are responsible for training many information professionals working across libraries, archives, museums, and cultural heritage organizations—institutions that have been discussed as key sites of DH work and partners for collaboration. This study draws on Spiro’s (2011) methodology, which examines assignments, readings, media types, key concepts, and technologies, in an attempt to characterize the “hidden curriculum” found throughout DH courses. In addition, we attend to issues of global similarities and local differences among the iSchool courses, as well as DH more broadly. In presenting this poster at the conference, we hope to raise awareness of unique aspects of DH education within iSchools and invite discussions with others about education and training in the field, potential partnerships, and pedagogical approaches.
