Nanohistory is a prototype digital history platform (https://www.nanohistory.org). It envisages the writing of history-as-data, using the smallest statements of historical action - nanohistories - which are documented as named graphs or 'quads'. The prototype is built on a synthesis of historiographical and information science theories focused on the role narrative and discourse play in recounting and studying the past. This paper will detail preliminary assessment of the prototype as a viable tool for historical research by a group of diverse 11 digital history projects over 2019-20. Funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the purpose of the assessment is to discern whether the prototype's synthesis of historical, network, and digital theories offers a viable digital historical methodology for documenting complex historical phenomena ranging from large-scale events, movement of people and artifacts, and discourse surrounding identities including gender, indigeneity, and religious culture.
