This proposal issues from a project on the diachrony of modality in Latin. The object of interestis the co-occurrence of modal markers in a Latin corpus, with a focus on the syntactic structures orlinguistic elements with which they interact. I propose a quantitative and structural analysis ofthis phenomenon by means of network analysis techniques. Despite the applications in humanitiesand specifically in linguistics, few models have been designed in order to study targetedlinguistic elements in co-occurrence, and classical languages received even less attention.
The final goal of this proposal is to show how such intersections between computational methodsand theoretical linguistic matters would provide a new and deeper insight on both disciplines.
