This lightning talk will present Transatlantic Cultures, a joint research project of faculty from universities in France, Brazil, the United States, Mexico, Senegal, and other countries. Its purpose is to produce a Digital Platform for Transatlantic Cultural History, edited in four languages which aims to analyze the cultural dynamics of the Atlantic region and its central role in the contemporary process of globalization. The online digital platform will present to the public a connected history of the Atlantic space since the end of the 18th century through a series of digitally enhanced analytical essays exploring cultural relations and exchanges between Europe, Africa, and the Americas from multidisciplinary perspectives.
