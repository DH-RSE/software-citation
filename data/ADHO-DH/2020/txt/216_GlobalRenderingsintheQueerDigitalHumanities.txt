How might DH textual scholars respond to call to queer DH practices, methodologies and projects? This panel brings together four papers investigating the queer margins of digital textual or methodological culture. Barnett considers the queer politics of metadata in digitisation projects identifying the way item-level markings become work-level interpretive interventions. Cytron deploys close and distant reading to position Eduardo Mendicutti’s 1982 radical act of queer world-building in a global context through analytical stylometry and TEI. Sumner considers the queer implications of distant reading techniques on the FBI files on Langston Hughes and James Baldwin, which conflate homosexuality, race, and poetics by identifying all three as “perversity.” Gairola deploys queer of color critique as a lens to read the intersectional nexus of queer and postcolonial theory through analyzing machine learning’s supposed ability to detect “gayface” with facial recognition software. Together, these papers identify and press upon diverse margins in global queer digital inscriptions.
