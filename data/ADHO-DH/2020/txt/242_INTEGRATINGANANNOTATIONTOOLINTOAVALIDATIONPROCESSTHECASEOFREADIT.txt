This poster aims to present a central element of the strategy for validating the concepts and data model of the READ-IT project (https://readit-project.eu), whose purpose is to explore reading experiences scattered in digital sources to answer such questions as “why” and “how” people read. But it still needed validation through an iterative process. In this regard, an specific annotation tool was developed. By annotating very specific characteristics of the act of reading, our tool has a triple function and takes place into a wider framework: 1) to validate a model and the ontology derived from it; 2) to produce vocabulary for specific thesauri; 3) to help answer the fundamental HSS research question of why and how people read through time and space. This tool, whose design is based on UX design approach, allows full integration of any ontology, as long as the ontology is RDF compliant.
