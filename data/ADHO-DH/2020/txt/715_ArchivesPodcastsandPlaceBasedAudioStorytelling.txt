This short presentation surveys podcasts and other forms of audio storytelling that remediate or otherwise make extensive use of archival materials from particular collections and institutions. It then focuses on recent efforts in a specific public humanities academic context to create podcasts and place-based audio storytelling projects that build on similar efforts from journalists, comedians, and cultural institutions. In distinguishing between "podcasts' and "place-based audio storytelling," this presentation also hopes to demonstrate how relationships between audience and place can be created and critiqued in this digital storytelling format.
