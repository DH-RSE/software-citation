The distinction in the sciences between developing new technologies and methods and the applied sciences which seek practical applications of scientific advances is a useful model for the digital humanities. A set of libraries and laboratories are leveraging DH methods such as natural language processing and machine vision towards practical applications that are immediately useful for researchers, library patrons and other end-users. This panel will feature a diverse set of libraries and laboratories describing case studies in which they have used DH-inspired and DH-derived methods and technologies to build tools that are changing approaches to service development. Case studies will include the creation of a multi-corpus text mining service, computer vision-based visualization tools, a data access service and service model, and a public volunteer program for transcribing documents. These will illuminate DH'sâ€™ impact outside of the academy, while offering lessons for practitioners that may help to expand this impact.
