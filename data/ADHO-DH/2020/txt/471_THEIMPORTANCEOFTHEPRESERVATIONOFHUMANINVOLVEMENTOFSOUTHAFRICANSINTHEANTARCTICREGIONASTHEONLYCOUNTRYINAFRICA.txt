The presentation will focus on the preserving of material linked to humanities of South Africa's involvement in the Antarctic region through a digital repository for the future generations of South Africa. The presentation will show the growth of the repository in the past decade through the collection of material through a small group of people involved in a specific geographical area. It will highlight that currently it is the only country within the Africa continent that is involved in the Antarctic region, therefore will highlight the importance of creating a open accessed digital repository.
