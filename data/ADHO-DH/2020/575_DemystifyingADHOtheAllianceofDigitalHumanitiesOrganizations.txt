This forum aims to "demystify ADHO," bringing together people with “insider knowledge” of ADHO based on their participation on multiple committees and in leadership roles in both ADHO and a few of its Constituent Organizations. These facilitators will give a series of lightning talks covering ADHO’s organizational structure, finances, committees, and activities, and they will then open the floor for questions and discussion. We welcome even the most difficult questions and topics and will strive to be honest and open about ADHO’s challenges.
