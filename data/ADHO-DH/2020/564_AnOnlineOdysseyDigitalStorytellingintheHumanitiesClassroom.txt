In the spirit of “carrefours/intersections,” I propose a short presentation highlighting the instructional benefits of interactive digital content in the humanities classroom. The primary source for this session will be a paper focused on addressing pedagogical concerns through digital methods, and detailing the process of creating visually dynamic and accessible content for literature classes. To supplement the paper, I will present a website designed to engage teachers and students in undergraduate instruction of James Joyce’s "Ulysses." As a work in progress, the website will be published to showcase potential uses of different design techniques and data visualization tools.
