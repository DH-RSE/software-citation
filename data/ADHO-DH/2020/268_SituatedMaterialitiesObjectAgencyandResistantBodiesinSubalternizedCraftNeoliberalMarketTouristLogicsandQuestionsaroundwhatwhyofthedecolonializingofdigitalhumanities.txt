This paper draws on ethnographic work in various indigenous and international contexts of digital archiving and on research in subaltern craft communities to think through the ontic/epistemic imaginaries (Verran, 2001) and the issues surrounding the inclusion of subaltern craft communities in digital global space either through museumizing or entrepreneurial promises of reaching global markets. In doing so, we raise questions regarding the scalar politics of “authenticity” from local to supranational contexts while problematizing notions of “untouched” cultural products.
