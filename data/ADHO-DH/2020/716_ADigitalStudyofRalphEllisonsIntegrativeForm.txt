In this project, I use classification of textual segments on the basis of parts of speech to examine how Ralph Ellison processes the form of his literary influences into the text of his canonical novel Invisible Man. The project is both a proof of concept for the use of DH in Ellison scholarship, where digital approaches remain quite rare, and a demonstration that parts of speech can successfully indicate authorial style and influence.
