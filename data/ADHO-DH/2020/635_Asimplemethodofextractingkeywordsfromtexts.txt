The proposal focuses on keywords extraction; its aim is two-fold. Firstly, the paper provides an evaluation of the existing techniques, namely log-likelihood keyword analysis, Zeta as developed by Burrows and refined by Craig, as well as TF-IDF weighting. Secondly, the paper introduces a brand-new method of extracting meaningful keywords, which relies on a simple observation that ordered word frequencies provide enough information about particular wordsâ€™ potential keyness.
