This paper examines the use of network theory to analyze data extracted from petitionary texts as a method to form prosopographical narratives of 13th century English society. The source material for this project is drawn from a sample of open-source digitized documents available from the British National Archives, Special Collections 8 (TNA, SC8), specifically the petitions from the late-13th-century addressed to Edward I.
