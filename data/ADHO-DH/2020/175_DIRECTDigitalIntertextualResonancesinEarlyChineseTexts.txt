In this talk, the creators will provide an introduction and demonstration of DIRECT (Digital Intertextual Resonances in Early Chinese Texts), a new digital tool designed to simplify phonological analysis of early Chinese texts. DIRECT enables users to quickly and easily identify homophonous and near-homophonous passages in ancient Chinese texts that may be obscured by graphic variation, uncovering hidden resonances and patterns.
