Greek Mythology contains numerous idiosyncratic familial relationships that pose unusual challenges for systematic analysis and visualisation. This project examines these idiosyncracies by using a subset of the Greek Mythology data collected according to the MANTO ontology developed by Dr Greta Hawes. This includes the design and development of a user-friendly web-based tool and graph layout that visualises and explores these complex relationships in the context of the digital humanities. In the process, it hopes to generate new avenues of research for data visualisation of complex linked open data structures, and raise societal awareness for unconventional "family" and "relationship" types.
