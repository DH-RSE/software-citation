This poster presents the new embedded researcher program of the National Library of the Netherlands (KB). To better understand the needs of researchers with regards to our data and services, we wanted to work together with them on short research projects. By doing so, we wished to create opportunities for young researchers to conduct their research and explore the KB content. In return, we hoped to benefit from their (technical) expertise to improve the user experience of the KB services. To achieve this, we set up an embedded researcher programme where we invite researchers from Dutch universities to come work with our data, programmers, and our research lab.
This poster introduces the program and the pilot projects that were done in the academic year of 2014â€“2015 with three Dutch universities.
