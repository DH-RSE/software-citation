Context
During the elaboration of his political theory,
the materialist
philosopher
Thomas
Hobbes
(1588-1679)
developed a complex relation with the Bible. Although he credited himself with the scientific foundation of politics,
in
The
Elements
of Law
(1640)
,
De Cive
(1642, 1647)
,
and
the English and Latin
Leviathan
(
1651, 1668
),
Hobbes
made an increasing use of Scriptural evidence in support of his arguments.
While
fight
ing
Scholastic philosop
h
y on its
own
ground,
not only
did he
la
y
the
foundations of
modern
B
iblical criticism,
but
he
also
provide
d
a
marked
ly heterodox interpretation
of
a growing number
of Scriptural
passages.
And y
et
,
t
he hundreds of Biblical quotations s
prinkled
in the political writings,
Hobbes’s
simultaneous use of
multiple Scriptural sources and his
inconsistent
handling of the source-texts make it
hard
to account for the nature and development of Hobbes’s treatment of the Bible.
That is why, w
ith the notable exception of the pioneering study by Harold W. Jones (
Jones,
1984), even modern scholarship has rarely dared to venture in a methodical examination of Hobbes’s
B
iblical knowledge and exegesis (Pacchi
et al.
, 198
8
; Somos, 2015).
O
bjectives
With this poster, we aim to showcase the benefits of a textometric approach to
what
Jones
defined
“
the problem of Hobbes and the Bible”
.
W
e draw on pilot evidence from
the
ongoing
Digital Theological Hobbes
project,
where
textometric functionalities
are
put in the service of the study of Hobbes’s
Biblical
discussions
thanks to
a
TXM-based
corpus of diplomatic transcriptions of
the
English political works.
Based on the
preliminary results obtained from the exploitation of
the
prototype
corpus, we
argue
that
the
unique combination of automatic and semi-automatic tools
of
the TXM so
f
tware
platform
<
>
(
Heiden,
2010
)
will enable to achieve
the following milestones:
1) a
n
index of Hobbes’s explicit Scriptural quotations in the political works;
2
) a quantitative and qualitative representation of both the evolution of Hobbes’s exegetical discussions and their growing impact on his political theor
y;
3
) the systematic contextualization of Hobbes’s Biblical references in his politic
al science
;
4
) the intertextual reconstruction of
the
Scriptural sources
of a relevant sample of quotations
.
First
r
esults
Our first results are the following:
1)
the
TXM-based
prototype
corpus of
diplomatic transcriptions of
Hobbes’s
English political works
,
built by
linguistically annotat
ing,
refining
and importing
the
XML-TEI
P5
-
encoded
(TEI Consortium, 2019)
EEBO-TCP
transcriptions
(Kichuk, 2007)
of
Human Nature
,
De Corpore Politico
,
Philosophicall Rudiments concerning Government and Society
and
Leviathan
(
freely accessible at
<
https://github.com/textcreationpartnership
>
)
into the open-source and TEI-oriented TXM software platform
.

TCP files are
annotated with standard spellings, parts of speech and lemmata

;
-
th
e
corpus is
i
nstrumented by
qualitative
(
like KWIC concordances
and
lexical
pattern progression graphs
)
and quantitative
(
like
lexical
pattern frequency lists,
co-occurrence
analyses, factorial
correspondence
analyses,
contrastive word specificit
ies
)
analysis tools;
-
the URS annotation
service
allows to manually annotate word sequenc
es
according to
a
Unit-Relation-Schema model
(Heiden, 2018).
2)
a demo of
the
automatic and semi-automatic tools
of
the
TXM-based
prototype
corpus
,
in order to:
-
systematic
ally
map and index
Hobbes’s
Scriptural
references ‘in vacuo’, i.e. “out of their contexts and with no consideration of the textual bases on which rest the quotations” (Jones, 1984:
274
),
see
Figs.
1 and
2
;
-
ground
the contextual study of Hobbes’s Biblical citations
and
the
intertextual analysis
of their
sources
by means of the URS
manual annotation service
,
see
Fig.

.
Conclusion
B
y shedding new light on Hobbes’s knowledge, use and handling of the Scriptures over time, we will
take a fundamental step forward in accomplishing Jones’s research agenda.
However,
we
will
also
make a methodological contribution to
many historical humanities. T
he
textometric
analysis of Hobbes’s
exegetical practices
will actually allow the development of a
computational approach to
the study of Biblical reception that could be applied to many modern textual corpora.
