In one day, we take participants through the entire workflow from having real manuscripts in your hands to performing complicated database computations on the texts these manuscripts contain. Examples are drawn from ancient Oriental manuscript cultures, because the specific complexities in these resources highlight the strength of applying new computer technologies. The focus of the workshop is on the underlying questions applying to the use of digital techniques in the study of material culture, languages, texts and literature. Therefore, the workshop is aimed at anyone dealing with manuscripts and texts, from Akkadian cuneiform economic texts to manuscripts of Classical Greek and Latin authors, and from Hebrew and Aramaic Dead Sea Scrolls to Middle Dutch devotional literature.
The workshop will provide a birdâ€™s eye view on the entire workflow that starts from the concrete physical carriers of text, through methods of character recognition, grammatical parsing, syntactic annotation, up to advanced methods of text-analytics e.g. topic modelling, linked data, and stylometry.
The workshop is divided into four stages, separated by breaks. Because of the hands-on component of the workshop we can accommodate up to 30 participants.
We will only require standard technical support (e.g. projector) and participants need to bring their own laptops with them. Instructions for the hands-on parts will be given at the beginning of the workshop (no pre-workshop installations is required).
