                <p>Libraries are sources of large-scale data: both in terms of their collections and the information they collate on their spaces, users, and systems. These data provide opportunities to explore technical, methodological, and ethical questions from the valuable interdisciplinary perspective of Data Science and the Digital Humanities.

These studies adopt methodological approaches and topics of study that contribute directly to our understanding of information sources in the digital humanities. However, there have been fewer studies that address critical humanistic perspectives to inform approaches to the data itself. This paper addresses that gap by describing our research into the users of NPLD materials in the United Kingdom, and the implications of automatic classification matching for library dataset analysis. It will address the following questions: what insights into users of digital library collections can be derived from automatic classification matching? What limitations are introduced by the use of existing classification schemes? And, in light of ongoing debates on responsible data curation in DH

To this end we were provided with two datasets comprising title-level NPLD access logs from the reading rooms of the six UK legal deposit libraries

                    </note>. The anonymous logs contained only bibliographic records of NPLD materials accessed by users, excluding both identifiable information about users and interactions with discovery systems and other materials. The first dataset comprised metadata for all eBook requests (total 91,809) from 31

                    <hi rend="superscript">st</hi> March 2017. The second dataset comprised metadata for all eJournal article requests (total 36,506) over the same period. Each dataset contained the following metadata: date and time of access request; originating legal deposit library; title of book or article; journal title (where applicable); publisher; and ISBN or ISSN. Each dataset was provided as a CSV file, then cleaned by the research team in OpenRefine to address metadata errors.

                <p> Although our dataset contained no identifiable information about users, it may still be possible to infer information about users from the works they consult.

This was partly due to missing key data fields in records for eJournals, and partly because many records did not have a corresponding classmark: time-consuming manual classification samples via OCLC Classify2 achieved only slightly higher accuracy rates. We discarded unclassified records used the remaining records to represent patterns of usage by DDC subject. Due to the large number of repeat requests due to system timeouts, we split the remaining records into unique titles (each title counted once regardless of number of requests), and total results (including repeat requests). Our results show that findings were not unduly influenced by repeat requests.

                <p>Social Sciences texts were notably among the most commonly accessed titles for both formats. The most common subject for eJournals was Technology, whereas for eBooks both Social Sciences and Literature subjects were more frequently accessed. Our findings reflect differing information behaviour across domains: books, for instance, remain a vital source for the Arts and Humanities

Previous studies have not, however, explored whether, or how, this variation is possibly related to factors such as domain size, the degree of scatter in a domain or domain-speciﬁc relevance criteria. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the development of a domain analytic approach for explaining the use and non-use of e-journals and databases. We identify and deﬁne factors to account for disciplinary differences in e-journal use, outline hypotheses to be tested more rigorously in future research, and test them initially on a limited data set. The empirical data was gathered as a part of a wider qualitative study exploring scholars’ use of networked resources in four different disciplines: nursing science, literature/cultural studies, history and ecological environmental science. The ﬁndings suggest that e-journals and databases are likely to be used most heavily in ﬁelds in which directed searching is the dominant search method and topical relevance the primary relevance type, and less in ﬁelds in which browsing and chaining are the dominant search methods and paradigmatic relevance the primary relevance type. The ﬁndings also support the Bates hypothesis that domain size has an important impact on the search methods used.","DOI":"10.1108/00220410310506312","ISSN":"0022-0418","shortTitle":"Reasons for the use and non‐use of electronic journals and databases","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Talja","given":"Sanna"},{"family":"Maula","given":"Hanni"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",12]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Talja and Maula, 2003), which tend to provide faster publication of new research.

                <p>The British Library receives proportionally fewer requests for NPLD medical and health materials. Our interviews with staff at the Bodleian and Cambridge University libraries showed that local medical school staff were a key user group, so we can trace a direct correlation between the user communities of these libraries, and the subjects of the NPLD material used. </p>

Here, for instance, DDC provides distinct categories for English, American, and classical European schools of literature, while lumping the rest of the world under “other literatures” (800-899). This bias emerges from the nineteenth century North American perspective embedded within DDC

The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) scheme is the most widely used library classification scheme in the world today; it is based on the shape of the 19th century North American academic world, and shows a distinct bias no longer acceptable for libraries of the 21st century. Non-Western languages and literatures are given short shrift in classes 400 and 800 of the DDC. The situation of African languages and literatures is a case in point. Attempts at official and local revisions have been made, but more systemic efforts are necessary. The problem is complex and there are no easy answers. Nevertheless, national libraries should step forward to address the issue, and the new models for adapting the DDC should be investigated.","DOI":"10.1515/LIBR.2004.256","author":[{"family":"Kua","given":"Eunice"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Kua, 2008). By relying on automatic matching, we inevitably embed problematic perspectives into our data: while our case study uses UK legal deposit collections, which comprise works represented strongly by DDC, the applicability of this method for library datasets in other parts of the world is questionable. Each time we zoom in with the macroscope, the bias of our chosen classification scheme becomes increasingly evident in the resultant data structures – yet in order to report on literature from without the established canon, we have to do precisely this. The use of established classification schemes is therefore both a methodological and epistemological problem, and future work will be needed to refine our approach.

                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Subjectify </hi>was successful in allowing us to analyse user behaviour at scale. It contributes to macroscopic analysis of library data in two ways: first, it allows us to report on bibliographic library users while maintaining privacy through data abstraction; and second, this abstraction allows us to identify patterns of user behaviour with NPLD materials. We believe this approach would work for subject-based analysis of similar collections of bibliographic data, and that it does so in a way that closely reflects how collections are represented in libraries. However, we are also aware that automated classification introduces the biases of those classification schemes into our own data

This is an unfortunate side effect of the growing scale of library data. Weingart (2014) notes that the role of the humanities is to tie the very distant to the very close, in order to become ethical stewards of our data. It is therefore essential, when viewing library datasets from a humanistic perspective, to consider the ethics of data representation in our own work. Our priority for future work is to consider how a fruitful conversation between DH and Information Science might develop more nuanced approaches to representing
