Introduction
Digital humanities
is an area of research and teaching at the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the
humanities
. Developing from the fields of humanities computing, humanistic computing,

digital humanities embraces a variety of topics, from curating online collections to data mining large cultural data sets. Digital humanities (often abbreviated DH) currently incorporates both digitized and
born-digital
materials and combines the methodologies from traditional humanities disciplines (such as
history
,
philosophy
,
linguistics
,
literature
,
art
,
archaeology
,
music
, and
cultural studies
) and social sciences

with tools provided by
computing
(such as
data visualisation
,
information retrieval
,
data mining
,
statistics
,
text mining
,
digital mapping
), and
digital publishing
. As well, related subfields of digital humanities have emerged like
software studies
, platform studies, and
critical code studies
. Digital Humanities also intersects with
new media studies
and
information science
as well as
media theory of composition
and
game studies
, particularly in areas related to digital humanities project design and production.
Example of research which includes the use of digital methods: network analysis as an archival tool.

Areas of inquiry
Digital humanities scholars use computational methods either to answer existing research questions or to challenge existing theoretical paradigms, generating new questions and pioneering new approaches. One goal is to systematically integrate computer technology into the activities of humanities scholars,
Opportunities/tabid/57/Default.aspx "Grant Opportunities"

National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of Digital Humanities Grant Opportunities
. Retrieved 25 January 2012.
as is done in contemporary empirical
social sciences
. Such technology-based activities might include incorporation into the traditional
arts
and
humanities
disciplines use of text-analytic techniques;
GIS
;
commons-based peer collaboration
; and interactive games and
multimedia
.
Despite the significant trend in digital humanities towards networked and multimodal forms of knowledge, spanning social, visual, and haptic media, a substantial amount of digital humanities focuses on documents and text in ways that differentiate the field's work from digital research in
Media studies
,
Information studies
,
Communication studies
, and
Sociology
. Another goal of digital humanities is to create scholarship than transcends textual sources. This includes the integration of
multimedia
,
metadata
and dynamic environments. An example of this is
The Valley of the Shadow
project at the
University of Virginia
, the
Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular
at
University of Southern California
or
Digital Pioneers projects at Harvard
.
A growing number of researchers in digital humanities are using computational methods for the analysis of large cultural data sets such as the
Google Books
corpus.

Digital humanities is also involved in the creation of software, providing "environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is 'born digital' and lives in various digital contexts."

The
Text Encoding Initiative
, born from the desire to create a standard encoding scheme for humanities electronic texts, is the outstanding achievement of early humanities computing. The project was launched in 1987 and published the first full version of the

Organizations and Institutions
The field of digital humanities is served by several organisations:
The Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing
(ALLC), the
Association for Computers and the Humanities
(ACH), and the
Society for Digital Humanities/Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs
(SDH/SEMI), which are joined under the umbrella organisation of the
Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations
(ADHO). The alliance funds a number of projects such as the
Digital Humanities Quarterly
, supports the
Text Encoding Initiative
, the organisation and sponsoring of workshops and conferences, as well as the funding of small projects, awards and bursaries.

Criticism and controversies
An edited text,
'Debates in the Digital Humanities' (2012)
has identified a range of criticisms of digital humanities: 'a lack of attention to issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; a preference for research-driven projects over pedagogical ones; an absence of political commitment; an inadequate level of diversity among its practitioners; an inability to address texts under copyright; and an institutional concentration in well-funded research universities'.
The literary theorist
Stanley Fish
claims that the digital humanities pursue a revolutionary agenda and thereby undermine the conventional standards of "pre-eminence, authority and disciplinary power."
Fish, Stanley (2012-01-09).
"The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality"
.
The New York Times
(New York). Retrieved 2012-05-30.
There has also been some recent controversy amongst practitioners of digital humanities around the role that race and/or identity politics plays in digital humanities. Tara McPherson attributes some of the lack of racial diversity in digital humanities to the modality of
UNIX
and computers, themselves.
An open thread on DHpoco.org recently garnered well over 100 comments on the issue of race in digital humanities, with scholars arguing about the amount that racial (and other) biases affect the tools and texts available for digital humanities research.
This is a current source of debate within the digital humanities.
At present, formal academic recognition of digital work in the humanities remains somewhat problematic, although there are signs that this might be changing.[
