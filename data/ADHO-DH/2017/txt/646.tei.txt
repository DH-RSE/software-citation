Participants/Call
We will send out a call for participation in form of a short tool presentation for the first part of the workshop. We will ask presenters to focus on the technical perspective of their tool answering the following key questions:
• What is the general workflow of the tool?
• What is the core functionality of the tool?
• What input and output formats does the tool accept? Or what interfaces does it expose? • What license model was chosen?
• What features are still missing and what are the next development goals? • How is maintenance and development of the tool organized? The deadline for the call is July 1st, 2017. We plan to accept 5-10 submission for our call, based on the usefulness of the tool and the potential for integration with other tools, which would all fit the first half of the workshop.
Audience
The target audience for this workshop are developers, historians with programming background, scholars with a technical background, and generally people involved in the development of tools to support historical research.
