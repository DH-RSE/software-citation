Audio Digitization Station
Begun in year one
(2014)
, this station sought to develop a technologically accessible digitization solution for audio-cassette tapes, most of which contain oral histories produced in the 1980s and 90s. We will outline the accessibility concerns at the heart of this project, including how the audio digitization protocol the project established sought to build organizational comfort with digitization practices by integrating the system with existing database infrastructures and ways of organizing volunteer labour at the archives. This part of the paper will also address how the Collaboratory identified trans audio collections within the archives, and will touch on some of the challenges in locating these materials. This material will be useful for humanities scholars in sexuality and gender studies who are concerned about creating digital preservation plans for audio-based primary source materials they might collect or create.
Mirha-Soleil Ross Papers
Begun in year three
(2016)
, this project is working to process, digitize, and improve access to the personal papers of Mirha-Soleil Ross, one of the most significant figures in transgender activism and cultural production in Canada. Donated to the archives in 2008, this large collection had not yet been processed by archives volunteers and as result, was mostly inaccessible to researchers. We are working in collaboration with Ms. Ross, and several members of the trans community, to organize these materials, determine access restrictions for sensitive content, create an online finding aid, and an online digital collection using the Omeka platform, which will sample from the larger volume of material. This part of the paper asks how digitization might provide an opportunity to repair damaged relationships between LGBT organizations and trans communities. It also considers some of the unique privacy concerns scholars must consider when providing online access to materials that document trans lives.
