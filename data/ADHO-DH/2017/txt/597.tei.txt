Sources and methodology
The dataset used in this investigation consists of the articles (or rather, pages) published between 1897 through 1908 that matched the query (worker OR workers OR workmen OR workman) AND (union) in the Chronicling America collection. The time period selected reflects the years surrounding the launching and high point of the employer open shop campaign, including the NAM's hiring of the publicity bureau noted above.
The identification of reprints is performed using the passim tool developed by David Smith for the Viral Texts project with the default settings (which were developed on Chronicling America material). The results are formatted into an HTML form for easier manual checking; as the algorithm inevitably identifies irrelevant reprints, the most laborious stage is the culling of the set of identified repeated passages.
The early-twentieth-century employer anti-union campaign had a recognizable vocabulary and set of themes, and it is the author's expertise, acquired developed through research on these employer campaigns, that is the main "method" for recognizing stories potentially put out by employers.
Results
As of current writing, I have processed
1906, 1907, and, partly, 1908
. For these years I have run the passim algorithm and manually examined the resulting identified reprinted clusters, which has turned out to be even more laborious than anticipated.
On the whole, I expected to see more stories clearly planted by NAM or its allies in readyprint or boilerplate. There are a number of candidates, but these are both less conclusive and have fewer reprints than I anticipated. There are, however, a few very widely reprinted clearly paid-for advertisements excoriating unions.
In some ways, the partly "negative" results in themselves are rather interesting (they seem not to be at least entirely due to any failings of the algorithmwidely printed items like speeches by the President are also prominent among the reprints). They seem to indicate that despite publicity bureaus' interest in claiming that material could be easily and discreetly planted, the task of shaping public opinion was more challenging that the NAM perhaps anticipated. The very fact that readyprint and boilerplate had to be palatable to a broad cross-section of papers, in an environment where there still were many labor or proworker papers, meant that "syndicated" material needed to be bland and apolitical to sell. Perhaps the democratic role of the press was better protected than expected?
