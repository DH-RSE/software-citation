        <p>The TEI schemas and guidelines have made it possible for many scholars and researchers to
          encode texts of any kind for (almost) all kinds of purposes, but this excellent standard
          is matched by an astounding diversity of publishing tools, which is particularly true when
          it comes to image-based digital editions. The different needs of scholars, coupled with
          the constant search for an effective price/result ratio and the local availability of
          technical skills, have led to a remarkable fragmentation: publishing solutions range from
          simple HTML pages produced using the <ptr type="software" xml:id="R106"
            target="#teistylesheets"/>
          <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R106">TEI stylesheets</rs> (or the <ptr type="software"
            xml:id="R107" target="#teiboilerplate"/>
          <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R107">TEI Boilerplate software</rs>) to very complex frameworks
          based on CMS and SQL search engines. Researchers of the Digital Vercelli Book project
          started looking into a simple, user-friendly solution and eventually decided to build
          their own: EVT (Edition Visualization Technology) has been under development since about
          2010 and has turned into a flexible tool that can be used to create a web-based digital
          edition starting from transcription files encoded in TEI XML. This paper describes why
          this tool was created, how it works, and developments planned for the future.</p>

          <p>When the transcription of the Vercelli Book manuscript (Codex CXVII, Archivio e
            Biblioteca Capitolare di Vercelli) passed the 50% landmark, researchers working on the
                project<note><p>The Digital Vercelli Book project, <ptr
                  target="http://vbd.humnet.unipi.it/"/>.</p></note> started to think about the best
            way to visualize the edition. Thanks to the openness and support of the Biblioteca
            Capitolare, it was decided to abandon the original plan of a CD/DVD publication, largely
            inspired by digital editions such as the <ref target="http://ebeowulf.uky.edu/"><title
                level="m">Electronic Beowulf</title></ref>,<note><p>Support site for the <title
                  level="m">Electronic Beowulf</title>, <ptr target="http://ebeowulf.uky.edu/"
                />.</p></note> in favor of a web-based publication. While this decision was critical
            in that it allowed us to select the most supported and widely-used medium, we soon
            discovered that it did not make choices any simpler. On the one hand, the <ptr

              >XSLT stylesheets</rs> provided by TEI are great for HTML rendering, but do not
            include support for image-related features (such as the text-image linking available
            thanks to the P5 version of the TEI schema) and tools (including zoom in/out, magnifying
            lens, and hot spots) that represent a significant part of a digital facsimile and/or
            diplomatic edition; other features, such as an XML search engine, would have to be
            integrated separately, in any case. On the other hand, there are powerful frameworks
            based on CMS<note><p>The <ptr type="software" xml:id="R2" target="#Omeka"/><rs

          <head>Standard vs. Fragmentation</head>
          <p>We concluded that, while the TEI schemas and Guidelines are a solid foundation for
            philological work, this excellent standard is matched by an astounding diversity of
            publishing tools, particularly when it comes to digital editions, especially editions
            that include images of manuscripts. As a consequence, a single scholar, or a small group
            of researchers, can easily encode an image-based edition in TEI XML, but will have to
            look for further support and resources to publish it, which is a serious obstacle to
            greater acceptance of digital philology methods and techniques. While continuing to
            inquire about a good, community-tested solution, and in spite of being aware of the
            dangers coming from the so-called NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome, we started looking
            into a project-specific solution that could fulfill our needs.</p>

                  target="http://infouma.di.unipi.it/laurea/index.asp"/>.</p></note> than a real
            attempt to solve the digital edition viewer problem. We aimed at investigating some user
            interfaceâ€“related aspects of such a viewer, in particular certain usability problems
            that are often underestimated by similar projects (<ref type="bibl" target="#rosselli11"
              >Rosselli Del Turco 2011</ref>), and at encouraging the use of standards to ensure the
            maximum longevity for the edition; we also considered releasing the source code as free
            software right from the start, since we firmly support open source and open access
            within the academic community. The first prototypes implemented on the basis of our
            concepts were promising, but eventually we reached a dead end: in spite of all our good
            intentions the User Interface (UI) looked cluttered; the software sported several
            secondary features, such as a rich text editing widget, but lacked critical ones
            (text-image linking, for instance), and was not fully stable, possibly as a result of
            too many widgets of different origins being used at the same time. On the architectural
            side, data was loaded straight into the web code, which had to be done by hand, with no
            options for configuration at all. In conclusion: not bad for a first attempt, but
            falling far short of our original goals.</p>

          <p>To get out of the impasse we decided to completely reboot the project, removing
            secondary features and giving priority to fundamental ones. We also found a solution for
            the data-loading problem: instead of finding a way to load the data into the software we
            decided to build the edition around the data itself. Making the TEI XML files the
            starting point means that the editor can focus on his work, marking up the transcription
            text, with very little configuration needed to create the edition. This approach also
            allowed us to quickly test XML files belonging to other edition projects, to check if
              <ptr type="software" xml:id="R108" target="#evt"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R108"
              >EVT</rs> could go beyond being a project-specific tool. The inspiration for these
            changes came from work done in similar projects developed within the TEI community,
            namely <ptr type="software" xml:id="R10" target="#teiboilerplate"/>

            Through this approach, we achieved two important results: first, usage of <ptr
              type="software" xml:id="R13" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R13">EVT</rs> is quite simpleâ€”the user applies an <ptr
              type="software" xml:id="R14" target="#XSLT"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R14">XSLT</rs>
            stylesheet to their already marked-up file(s), and when the processing is finished they
            are presented with a web-ready edition; second, the web edition that is produced is
            based on a client-only architecture and does not require any additional kind of server
            software, which means that it can be simply copied on a web server to be used at once,
            or even on a cloud storage service (provided that it is accessible by the general
            public).</p>
          <p>To ensure that it will be working on all the most recent web browsers, and for as long
            as possible on the World Wide Web itself, <ptr type="software" xml:id="R15"
              target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R15">EVT</rs> is built on open and standard web technologies
            such as HTML, CSS, and <ptr type="software" xml:id="R16" target="#JavaScript"/><rs
              type="soft.name" ref="#R16">JavaScript</rs>. Specific features, such as the magnifying
            lens, are entrusted to jQuery plug-ins, again chosen from the best-supported open-source
            ones to reduce the risk of future incompatibilities. The general architecture of the
            software, in any case, is modular, so that any component which may cause trouble or turn
            out to be not completely up to the task can be replaced easily.</p>

          <p>Our ideal goal was to have a simple, very user-friendly drop-in tool, requiring little

              xml:id="R17" target="#XSLT"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R17">XSLT</rs>
            <rs type="soft.ver" ref="#R17">2.0</rs> transformations calling in turn all the other
            modules. The latter belong to two general categories: those devoted to building the HTML
            site, and the XML processing ones, which extract the edition text lying between folios
            using the <gi>pb</gi> element and format it according to the edition level. All <ptr
              type="software" xml:id="R18" target="#XSLT"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R18">XSLT</rs>
            modules live inside the <ident>builder_pack</ident> folder, in order to have a clean and
            well-organized directory hierarchy. <figure xml:id="fig1">

          <p>Therefore, assuming the available formatting stylesheets meet your projectâ€™s criteria,
            to create a digital edition you only have to follow three simple steps: <list
              rend="bulleted">
              <item>copy the edition data into the data/input_data folder: there are different
                sub-folders for text (TEI XML documents) and images (these have to follow a specific
                naming convention);</item>
              <item>optionally you can modify transformation options by editing
                  <ident>evt_builder-conf.xsl</ident>, to specify for example the number of edition
                levels or presence of images;</item>
              <item>you can then apply the <ident>evt_builder.xsl</ident> stylesheet to your TEI XML
                document using the <ptr type="software" xml:id="R20" target="#oxygen"/><rs

          <p>The <ptr type="software" xml:id="R110" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R110">EVT</rs> builderâ€™s transformation system is composed of
            a modular collection of <ptr type="software" xml:id="R25" target="#XSLT"/><rs
              type="soft.name" ref="#R25">XSLT</rs>
            <rs type="ver" ref="#R25">2.0</rs> stylesheets: these modules are designed to permit
            scholars to freely add their own stylesheets and to manage the different desired levels
            of the edition without influencing other parts of the system, for instance the
            generation of the home page.</p>
          <p>The transformation is performed applying a specific <ptr type="software" xml:id="R26"
              target="#XSLT"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R26">XSLT</rs> stylesheet
              (<ident>evt_builder.xsl</ident>) which includes links to all the other stylesheets
            that are part of the transformation chain and that will be applied to the TEI XML
            document containing the transcription.</p>
          <p><ptr type="software" xml:id="R27" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R27">EVT</rs> can be used to create image-based editions with
            different edition levels starting from a single encoded text. The text of the
            transcription must be divided into smaller parts to recreate the physical structure of
            the manuscript. Therefore, it is essential that paginated XML documents are marked using
            a TEI page break element (<gi>pb</gi>) at the start of each new page or folio side, so
            that the transformation system will be able to recognize and handle everything that
            stands between a <gi>pb</gi> element and the next one as the content of a single
            page.</p>
          <p>The system is designed to generate an arbitrary number of edition levels: as a
            consequence, the user is required to indicate how many (and which) output levels they
            intend to create by modifying the corresponding parameter in the configuration file.</p>
          <p>The following code segment shows the default configuration with two edition levels:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <xsl:variable name="edition_array" as="element()*"
                xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
                <edition>Diplomatic</edition>
                <edition>Interpretative</edition>
              </xsl:variable>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The user can change the number of output levels simply by adding or removing an
              <gi>edition</gi> element in the <ident>evt_builder-conf.xsl</ident> file, and they can
            also personalize the editionâ€™s name by changing the content of the <gi>edition</gi>
            element. For example, if they wish to generate a critical level, they are required to
            add <code>&lt;edition&gt;Critical&lt;/edition&gt;</code> to the
              <ident>edition_array</ident> variable.<note><p>The available edition levels are
                described in the software documentation. Adding another edition level requires
                providing the corresponding stylesheet.</p></note></p>
          <p>Once the XML file is ready and the parameters are set, the <ptr type="software"
              xml:id="R111" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R111">EVT</rs> builderâ€™s transformation system uses a
            collection of stylesheets to divide the XML file containing the text of the
            transcription into smaller portions, each one corresponding to the content of a folio,
            recto or verso, of the manuscript. For each of these text fragments it creates as many
            output files as requested by the file settings.</p>
          <p>In order to create the contents of these files, templates required to handle the
            edition level are selected by using the value of their <att>mode</att> attribute. For
            example, by associating the transformation for the diplomatic edition to the
              <ident>dipl</ident> mode, the correct content of the pages of this edition is obtained
            applying the templates that have <val>dipl</val> as value for <att>mode</att>. This
            requires that each one of the pages selected by the system is processed by an
              <!-- [RvdB] changed "current-group" to "current-group()" --><tag type="empty"
              >xsl:apply-templates select="current-group()" mode="dipl"</tag> instruction before its
            content is inserted into the diplomatic output file.</p>
          <p>Using <ptr type="software" xml:id="R28" target="#XSLT"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R28"
              >XSLT</rs> modes it is possible to separate the rules for the different
            transformations of a TEI element and to recall other <ptr type="software" xml:id="R29"
              target="#XSLT"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R29">XSLT</rs> stylesheets in order to
            manage the transformations or send different parts of a document to different parts of
            the transformation chain. This permits the extraction of different texts for different
            edition levels (diplomatic, diplomatic-interpretative) processing the same XML file, and
            to save them in the HTML site structure, which is available as a separate <ptr
              type="software" xml:id="R30" target="#XSLT"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R30">XSLT</rs>
            module.</p>
          <p>The use of modes also allows users to separate template rules for the different
            transformations of a TEI element and to place them in different <ptr type="software"
              xml:id="R31" target="#XSLT"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R31">XSLT</rs> files or in
            different parts of a single stylesheet. So templates such as the following <egXML
              xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><xsl:template match="tei:abbr" mode="dipl"
                xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"/></egXML> and <egXML
              xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><xsl:template match="tei:abbr" mode="int"
                xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"/></egXML> can be placed in
            different stylesheets or in different parts of the same stylesheet without generating
            conflicts.</p>
          <p>If the TEI elements that are processed are placed in an HTML element and these
            elementsâ€™ <att>class</att> attribute values are based on the scheme
              <ident>[edition_level]-[TEI_elementâ€™s_name]</ident>,<note><p>For example, to process
                the element <gi>abbr</gi> for the diplomatic edition:
              <ident>dipl-abbr</ident>.</p></note> it is then possible to retain the semantic
            information contained in the markup and, if necessary, to associate the element with the
            corresponding class in the CSS rules so as to specify the visualization and highlighting
            of the item.</p>
          <p>As already stated above, the editors will be able to freely add their own stylesheets
            in order to personally manage the different levels of the desired edition. What is
            required from users is to: <list rend="bulleted">
              <item>personalize the edition generation parameter as shown above;</item>
              <item>copy their own <ptr type="software" xml:id="R32" target="#XSLT"/><rs
                  type="soft.name" ref="#R32">XSLT</rs> files containing the template rules to
                generate the desired edition levels in the directory that contains the stylesheets
                used for TEI element transformation
                (<ident>builder_pack/modules/elements</ident>);</item>
              <item>include the new stylesheets in the file used to start the transformation chain
                  (<ident>builder_pack/evt_builder.xsl</ident>);</item>
              <item>associate a mode value to the new edition level transformation;</item>
              <item>add a <att>mode</att> attribute with the corresponding value to all the template
                rules used for that transformation.</item>
            </list>
          </p>
          <p>For the time being, this kind of customization has to be done by hand-editing the
            configuration files, but in a future version of <ptr type="software" xml:id="R33"
              target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R33">EVT</rs> we plan to add a more user-friendly way to

                chapter 11, <title level="a">Representation of Primary Sources</title>, in the <ref

            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R35">EVT</rs>, or require only minor changes to be made
            compatible. The Vercelli Book transcription schema is based on the standard TEI schema,
            with no custom elements or attributes added: our tests with similarly encoded texts
            showed a high grade of compatibility. A critical edition level is currently being
            researched and it will be added in the future.</p>
          <p>When the website produced by <ptr type="software" xml:id="R36" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R36">EVT</rs> is loaded in a browser, the viewer will be
            presented with the manuscript image on the left side, and the corresponding text on the
            right: this is the default view, but on the main toolbar at the top right corner of the
            browser window there are icons to access all the available views: <list>
              <item><soCalled>Image-Text</soCalled> view: as mentioned above, this is the default
                view showing a manuscript folio image and the corresponding text in one or more
                edition levels;</item>
              <item><soCalled>Text-Text</soCalled> view: conceived to compare different edition

                toolbar;</item>
              <item><soCalled>Bookreader</soCalled>: this view expands the image frame to show
                double-side images of the manuscript (that is showing the <emph>verso</emph> side of
                a folio and the following oneâ€™s <emph>recto</emph> side). At the moment it is
                necessary that these images be double-sided; in a future version of EVT it will be
                possible to place single folio images side-by-side and to browse them in a
                synchronized way.</item>
            </list>
            <figure xml:id="fig3">

            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>It is interesting to notice how the <soCalled>bookreader</soCalled> view is
            automatically populated with content during the transformation phase with no action
            required by the editor. The only necessary requirement at the encoding level, in fact,
            is that the editor should encode folio numbers by means of the <gi>pb</gi> element
            including <mentioned>r</mentioned> and <mentioned>v</mentioned> letters to mark recto
            and verso pages, respectively. <ptr type="software" xml:id="R37" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R37">EVT</rs> will take care of automatically associating
            each folio to the images copied in the <ident>input_data/images</ident> folder using a
              <soCalled>verso-recto</soCalled> naming scheme (for example:
              <ident>104v-105r.png</ident>). It is of course possible that in some cases the
            transformation process is unable to return the correct result: this is why we decided to
            save this kind of information in an XML file, <ident>structure.xml</ident>, separate and
            independent from the HTML interface; this file will be updated automatically every time
            the transformation process is started and can be customized by the editor.</p>
          <p>Although the different views access different kinds of content, such as single side and
            double side images, the navigation algorithms used by <ptr type="software" xml:id="R38"
              target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R38">EVT</rs> allow the user to move from one view to another
            without losing the current browsing position.</p>
          <p>All content is shown inside HTML frames designed to be as flexible as possible. No
            matter what view one is currently in, one can expand the desired frame to focus on its
            specific content, temporarily hiding the other components of the user interface. It is
            furthermore possible to collapse the frame toolbars to increase the space devoted to
            content visualization; it is important to notice, however, that we recommend using <ptr
              type="software" xml:id="R112" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R112">EVT</rs> in full-screen mode to see images and text at
            the maximum possible screen resolution. The collapse and restore actions are triggered
            by icons embedded in the interface, but one can also press the <ident>Esc</ident> key to
            instantly return to the default layout.</p>
          <p>On the image side, several tools are available to improve analysis of manuscript
            images. The zoom feature is always active, so that the user can zoom in or out at any
            time by means of the mouse scroll wheel or using the appropriate slider in the bottom
            toolbar. More tools are available on the top toolbar: <list rend="bulleted">
              <item><soCalled>Magnifier</soCalled>: a magnifying lens to explore the manuscript
                images in greater detail; the lens shows an area of a high resolution version of the
                same folio image, which means a better view compared to the standard zoom
                feature.</item>
              <item><soCalled>HotSpot</soCalled>: if activated, areas of the images for which there
                are specific notes and/or details will be highlighted. Clicking on them will call up
                a pop-up window with the related information. This feature is quite recent and still
                needs to be refined; the pop-up window may be replaced by a better solution. </item>
              <item><soCalled>TextLink</soCalled>: when this feature is active, lines in the
                manuscript are highlighted and linked to the corresponding lines of the edition
                text, and vice versa.</item>
              <item><soCalled>Thumbnails</soCalled>: will show miniature images for all the
                available manuscript digitized folios.</item>

          <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R43">EVT</rs> development will continue during 2014 to fix bugs
          and to improve the current set of features, but there are also several important features

          <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R44">EVT</rs>. Some of the planned features will require
          fundamental changes to the software architecture to be implemented effectively: this is
          probably the case for the <ptr type="software" xml:id="R121"

          <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R121">Digital Lightbox</rs> (see <ptr type="crossref" target="#lightbox"

            target="#architecture"/>), instead of the current client-only model, to perform some of
          the existing and planned actions. The currently developed search engine (<ptr
            type="crossref" target="#searchengine"/>) may prove too limited when dealing with larger
          text collections, but thanks to the new architecture it will be possible to consider new,

          <p>One important aspect that has been introduced in the current version of <ptr

            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R45">EVT</rs> is a completely revised layout: the current
            user interface includes all the features which were deemed necessary for the Digital
            Vercelli Book beta, but it also is ready to accept the new features planned for the
            short and medium terms. Note that nontrivial changes to the general appearance and
            layout of the resulting web edition will be necessary, and this is especially the case
            for the XML search engine and for the critical edition support. Fortunately the basic
            framework is flexible enough to be easily expanded by means of new views or a redesign
            of the current ones.</p>

          <p>The <ptr type="software" xml:id="R46" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R46">EVT</rs> search engine is already working and being
            tested in a separate development branch of the software; merging into the main branch is
            expected as soon as the user interface is finalized. It was implemented with the goal of
            keeping it simple and usable for both academics and the general public.</p>
          <p>To achieve this goal we began by studying various solutions that could be used as a
            basis for our efforts. In the first phases of this study we looked at the principal XML
            databases, such as of <ptr type="software" xml:id="R47" target="#BaseX"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R47">BaseX</rs>, <ptr type="software" xml:id="R48"
              target="#eXistdb"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R48">eXist</rs>, etc., and we found a solution by envisioning
              <ptr type="software" xml:id="R49" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R49">EVT</rs> as a distributed application using the
            client-server architecture. For this test we selected the <ptr type="software"
              xml:id="R50" target="#eXistdb"/>
            <ref target="http://exist-db.org/"><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R50"
                >eXist</rs></ref><note><p>eXist-db, <rs type="url" ref="#R50"><ptr
                    target="http://exist-db.org/"/></rs>.</p></note> open source XML database, and
            in a relatively short time we created, sometimes by trial-and-error, a prototype that
            queried the database for keywords and highlighted them in context.</p>
          <p>While this model was a step in the right direction and partially operational, we also
            felt that it was not sufficiently user-friendly, which is a critical goal of the entire
            project. In fact, forcing the editor to install and configure specific server software
            is a cumbersome requirement. Moreover, thanks to its client-only architecture, up to
            this point <ptr
              type="software" xml:id="R114" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R114">EVT</rs> could work as a desktop application or an off-line web application that
            could be accessed anywhere, and possibly distributed in optical formats (CD or DVD).
            Forcing the prerequisites of an Internet connection and of dependency on a server-based
            XML database would have undermined our original goal. Going the database route was no
            longer an option for a client-only <ptr type="software" xml:id="R51" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R51">EVT</rs> and we immediately felt the need to go back to
            our original architecture to meet this standard. This sudden turnaround marked another
            chapter in the research process and brought us to the current implementation of <ptr
              type="software" xml:id="R115" target="#EVT"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R115">EVT</rs>
            Search.</p>
          <p>However, this new vision also had obvious limitations and issues. An XML database could
            provide us with crucial functionality typical of every information retrieval system: an
            indexer, a powerful and flexible server-side language (XQuery), and some useful built-in
            functions for semantic and linguistic analysis (such as keyword in context and
            concordances). It became clear that our implementation should take those missing
            functionalities into account and consider alternative technologies.</p>
          <p>To simplify the planning process, we focused on the bare functionalities that would be
            expected by the user. Essentially, we found that at least two of them were needed in
            order to make a functional search engine: free-text search and keyword highlighting. To
            implement them we looked at existing search engines and plug-ins programmed in the most
            popular client-side web language: <ptr type="software" xml:id="R52" target="#JavaScript"
              /><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R52">JavaScript</rs>. In the end, our search produced two
            answers: <emph><ptr type="software" xml:id="R53" target="#tipuesearch"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R53">Tipue Search</rs></emph> and <emph>DOM

              search engine released under the MIT license and aimed at indexing and searching large
              collections of web pages. It can function both offline and online, and it does not
              necessarily require a web server or a server-side programming/query language (such as
              SQL, PHP, or Python) in order to work. While technically a plug-in, its architecture
              is quite interesting and versatile: <ptr type="software" xml:id="R116" target="#tipuesearch"/>

            <p>This plug-in suited our needs very well, but had to be modified slightly in order to
              accommodate the requirements of the entire project. Before using <ptr type="software"
                xml:id="R63" target="#tipuesearch"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R63">Tipue</rs> to handle the search we needed to generate
              the data structure that was going to be used by the engine to perform the queries. We
              explored some existing XSL stylesheets aimed at TEI to JSON transformation, but we
              found them too complex for the task at hand. So we modified our own stylesheets to
              produce the desired output.</p>
            <p>This output consists of two JSON files: <list rend="bulleted">
                <item><ident>diplomatic.json</ident> contains the text of the diplomatic edition of
                  the Vercelli Book;</item>
                <item><ident>facsimile.json</ident> contains the text of the facsimile edition of
                  the Vercelli Book.</item>
              </list>
            </p>
            <p>These files are produced by including two templates in the overall flow of <ptr
                type="software" xml:id="R64" target="#XSLT"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R64"
                >XSLT</rs> transformations that extract crucial data from the TEI documents and
              format them with JSON syntax. The procedure complements well the entire logic of
              automatic self-generation that characterizes <ptr type="software" xml:id="R65"
                target="#EVT"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R65">EVT</rs>.</p>
            <p>After we managed to extract the correct data structure, we began to include the
              search functionality in <ptr type="software" xml:id="R66" target="#EVT"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R66">EVT</rs>. By using the logic behind <ptr
                type="software" xml:id="R67" target="#tipuesearch"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R67">Tipue</rs> JSON mode, we implemented a trigger (under
              the shape of a select tag) that loaded the desired JSON data structure to handle the
              search (diplomatic or facsimile, as mentioned above) and a form that managed the query
              strings and launched the search function. Additionally, we decided to provide the user
              with a simple virtual keyboard composed of essential keys related to the Anglo-Saxon
              alphabet used in the Vercelli Book.</p>
            <p>The performance of <ptr type="software" xml:id="R68" target="#tipuesearch"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R68">Tipue Search</rs> was deemed acceptable and our tests
              showed that even large collections of data did not pose any particular problem.</p>

            <head> Keyword Highlighting through DOM Manipulation</head>
            <p>The solution to keyword highlighting was found while searching many plug-ins that
              deal with this very problem. All these plug-ins use <ptr type="software" xml:id="R69"
                target="#JavaScript"/><rs type="soft.name" ref="#R69">JavaScript</rs> and DOM
              manipulation in order to wrap the HTML text nodes that match the query with a specific
              tag (a span or a user-defined tag) and a CSS class to manage the style of the
              highlighting. While this implementation was very simple and self-explanatory, making
              use of simple recursive functions on relevant HTML nodes has proved to be very
              difficult to apply to the textual contents handled by <ptr type="software"
                xml:id="R70" target="#EVT"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R70">EVT</rs>.</p>
            <p>HTML text within <ptr type="software" xml:id="R72" target="#EVT"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R72">EVT</rs> is represented as a combination of text nodes
              and <gi>span</gi> elements. These spans are used to define the characteristics of the
              current selected edition. They contain both philological information about the inner
              workings of the text and information about its visual representation. Very often the
              text is composed of spans that handle different versions of words (such as the
              sub-elements of the TEI <gi>choice</gi> element) or highlight an area of a word (based
              on the TEI <gi>hi</gi> element, for example).</p>
            <p>This type of markup would not have constituted a problem if it had wrapped complete
              words, since the plug-ins could recursively explore its content and search for a
              matching term. In certain portions of the text, however, some letters are separated by
              a span from the rest of the word (for example:
                <code>&lt;span&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ello</code>). Since the plug-ins worked on the level
              of text nodes, a word split by spans would be seen as two different text nodes (for
              example: <mentioned>H</mentioned> and <mentioned>ello</mentioned>) and could not be
              matched by the query, making the standard transversal algorithm of the plug-ins
              impossible to use without any further substantial modifications.</p>
            <p>To solve this problem we recreated the transversal algorithm entirely, making it more
              intelligent and context-sensitive. In order to do so, we explored the text to be
              highlighted by using a map that kept track of all the spans and text nodes and their
              starting and ending position in this flow. At the end of the process, we simply
              inserted the span elements (or the user-defined elements) in the positions marked by
              the map. <figure xml:id="fig6">

              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>We found the performance of this solution acceptable and our text showed that even
              dynamic highlighting (performed as the user inputs text) posed no problem for this
              implementation.</p>

              documents encoded according to the traditional transcription method. Since we think
              that this is a concrete need in many cases of study (mainly epigraphical inscriptions,
              but also manuscripts, at least in some specific cases), we recently added a new
              feature that will allow <ptr type="software" xml:id="R75" target="#EVT"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R75">EVT</rs> to handle texts encoded according to the
              embedded transcription method. This work was possible due to a small grant awarded by
                  EADH.<note><p>See EADH Small Grant: Call for Proposals, <ptr

            <head>Support for Critical Edition</head>
            <p>One important feature whose development will start at some point this year is the
              support for critical editions, since at the present moment <ptr type="software"
                xml:id="R76" target="#EVT"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R76">EVT</rs> allows dealing only with diplomatic and
              interpretative ones. We aim not only to offer full support for the TEI Critical
              Apparatus module, but also to find an innovative layout that can take advantage of the
              digital medium and its dynamic properties to go beyond the traditional, static,
              printed page: <quote source="#quoteref1">The layers of footnotes, the multiplicity of
                textual views, the opportunities for dramatic visualization interweaving the many
                with each other and offering different modes of viewing the one within the manyâ€”all
                this proclaims <q>I am a hypertext: invent a dynamic device to show me</q>. The
                computer is exactly this dynamic device</quote> (<ref type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref1"
                target="#robinson05">Robinson 2005, Â§ 12</ref>).</p>
            <p>A digital edition can, of course, maintain the traditional layout, possibly moving
              the apparatus from the bottom of the page to a more convenient position, but could and
              should also explore different ways of organizing and displaying the connection between
              edition text and the critical apparatus: even if an electronic screen is just as
              limited by its two-dimensional form factor as a printed book, there are several ways
              to overcome this limitation, which we intend to research and test until we find an
              effective solution.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, a real added value granted by the digital medium is the opportunity to
              transcribe completely every witness and to visualize the different readings of each
              one in the wider context of the text of the witness itself, and not only as a single,
              isolated variant inside the critical apparatus. In fact, thanks to hypertextual links,
              it is possible to connect every single entry to the precise fragment of text where it
              belongs, allowing a deeper study and an easier comparison of the main text and the
              variant texts. A tool based on this approach would really take advantage of the
              dynamic and hypertextual nature of a web-based edition.</p>
            <p>Some of the problems related to this approach are related to the user interface and
              the way it should be designed in order to be usable and useful: how to conceive and
              where to place the graphical widgets holding the critical apparatus, how to integrate
              these UI elements in <ptr type="software" xml:id="R77" target="#EVT"/>
              <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R77">EVT</rs>, how to contextualize the variants and
              navigate through the witnessesâ€™ texts, and more. There are other problems, for
              instance scalability issues (how to deal with very big textual traditions that count
              tens or even hundreds of witnesses?) or the handling of texts produced by collation
              software, which strictly depend on the current TEI Critical Apparatus module.
              Considering that there is a subgroup of the TEIâ€™s Manuscript Special Interest Group
              devoted to significantly improving this module, we can only hope that at least some of
              these problems will be addressed in a future version.</p>

                available at  <rs type="soft.url" ref="#R79"><ptr target="http://lightbox-dev.dighum.kcl.ac.uk"/></rs>.</p></note> is a
            web-based visualization framework which aims to support historians, paleographers, art
            historians, and others in analyzing and studying digital reproductions of cultural
            heritage objects. The methodology of research inspiring development of this tool is to
            study paleographic elements in a qualitative way, helping scholarsâ€™ interpretations as
            much as possible, and therefore to reject any automatic methods such as pattern
            recognition and clustering which are supposed to return quantitative and objective
            results. Although ongoing projects making use of these computational methods are very
            promising, the results that may be obtained at this time are still significantly less
            precise (with regard to specific image features, at least) than those produced through
            human interpretation.</p>
          <p>Initially developed exclusively for paleographic research, the <ptr type="software"
              xml:id="R80" target="#digitallightbox"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R80">Digital Lightbox</rs> may be used with any type of image
            because it includes a set of general graphic tools. Indeed, the application allows a
            detailed and powerful analysis of one or more images, arranged in up to two available
            workspaces, providing tools for manipulation, management, comparison, and transformation
            of images. The development of this project is consistently tested by paleographers at
            Kingâ€™s College London working on the DigiPal project, who are using the web application
            as a support for analyzing and gathering samples of paleographic elements.</p>
          <p>The software offers a rich set of tools: besides basic functions such as resizing,
            rotation, and dragging, it is possible to use a set of filtersâ€”such as opacity,
            brightness, color inversion, grayscale effect, and contrastâ€”which, used in combination,
            are able to significantly improve the quality of digital images or specific areas of
            them. For example, one of the possible applications for filters is the improvement of
            burned or otherwise damaged manuscripts, which are obviously much more difficult to read
            and transcribe. Images can also be compared using an automatic tool which allows the
            user to merge two images, returning a third one made up of the differences between them.
            A typical application of the combined use of these tools is the disambiguation of
            different types of the same character (allographs, according to the DigiPal
            terminology). <figure xml:id="fig7">

          <p>Collaboration is a very important characteristic of <ptr type="software" xml:id="R81"
              target="#digitallightbox"/>
            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R81">Digital Lightbox</rs>: what makes this tool stand apart
            from all the image-editing applications available is the possibility of creating and
            sharing the work done using the software framework. First, you can create collections of
            images and then export them to the local disk as an XML file; this feature not only
            serves as a way to save the work, but also to share specific collections with other
            users. Moreover, it is possible to export (and, consequently, to import) working
            sessions, or, in other words, the current status of the work being done using the
            application: in fact, all the images, letters, and notes present on the workspace will
            be saved when the user leaves and restored when they log in again. These features have
            been specifically created to encourage sharing and to make collaborative work more
            effective and easy. Thanks to a new HTML5 feature, it is possible to support the
            importing of images from the local disk to the application without any server-side
            function.</p>

            <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R93">EVT</rs> or, more precisely, a separate version of <ptr

            collaborative work and annotation, we believe that even a subset of the available tools
            will be an invaluable help for manuscript image analysis. Furthermore, as noted above,
            thanks to HTML5 and CSS3 it will become more and more feasible to implement features in
            a client-only mode.</p>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>Started as an experimental, project-based learning initiative to explore issues related
          to the publishing of TEI-encoded digital editions, this software has grown to the point of
          being a potentially very useful tool for the TEI community: since it requires little
          configuration, and no knowledge of programming languages or web frameworks except for what
          is needed to apply an <ptr type="software" xml:id="R103" target="#XSLT"/><rs
            type="soft.name" ref="#R103">XSLT</rs> stylesheet, it represents a user-friendly method
          for producing image-based digital editions. Moreover, its client-only architecture makes
          it very easy to test the edition-building process (one has only to delete the output
          folders and start anew) and publish preliminary versions on the web (a shared folder on
          any cloud-based service such as Dropbox is all that is needed).</p>
        <p>While <ptr type="software" xml:id="R104" target="#EVT"/>
          <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R104">EVT</rs> has been under development for 3â€“4 years, it was
          thanks to the work and focus required by the Digital Vercelli Book release at end of 2013
          that we now have a solid foundation on which to build new features and refine the existing
          ones. Some of the future expansions also pose important research questions: this is the
          case with the critical edition support, which touches a sensitive area of the very recent
          digital philology discipline.<note><p>Digital philology makes use of ICT methods and
              tools, such as text encoding, in the context of textual criticism and philological
              study of documents to produce digital editions of texts. While many of the first
              examples of such editions were well received (see for instance <ref type="bibl"
                target="#kiernan13">Kiernan 2013</ref>; also see <ref type="bibl"
                target="#siemens12">Siemens 2012</ref> for an example of the new theoretical
              possibilities allowed by the digital medium), serious doubts concerning not only their
              durability and maintainability, but also their methodological effectiveness, have been
              raised by some scholars. The debate is still ongoing, see <ref type="bibl"
                target="#gabler10">Gabler 2010</ref>, <ref type="bibl" target="#robinson05">Robinson

          <rs type="soft.name" ref="#R105">Digital Lightbox</rs> are also critical to the way modern
          scholars interact and share their research findings. Finally, designing a user interface
          capable of hosting all the new features, while remaining effective and user-friendly, will
          itself be very challenging.</p>
