        <p>The Indiana University (IU) Libraries have a long history of using the TEI markup
          standard to encode and publish electronic texts, but choosing the best publishing platform
          has been challenging for certain projects. Before formally launching an open access
          journal publishing program in 2008, the Libraries collaborated with two scholarly journals
          to provide open access publishing using P3 SGML and P4 XML TEI encoding delivered through
          the DSpace and XTF platforms. Both journals used complex encoding, transformation, and
          delivery workflows that required copious amounts of custom software development to
          function properly. As these systems aged, the time and effort required to maintain them
          steadily increased. In 2013, the Libraries began planning to migrate these journals into
          the <ref target="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/">Open Journal Systems</ref> (OJS)<note>Public
            Knowledge Project, accessed January 8, 2018, <ptr target="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/"
            />.</note> platform while preserving the TEI markup.</p>
        <p>Both journals are now publishing using the OJS platform. The <title level="j"><ref
              target="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/">Indiana Magazine of
              History</ref></title><note>Accessed January 8, 2018, <ptr
              target="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/"/>.</note> was successfully
          launched in OJS in August 2014, and <title level="j"><ref
              target="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/">The Medieval

              target="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/"/>.</note> was launched in
          June 2015. Publishing in this manner leverages the IU Libraries’ strengths in electronic
          text projects and XML workflows within an easy-to-use, flexible platform that journal
          editors appreciate. The success of these migrations presents a new framework for future
          XML publishing of open access journals at Indiana University.</p>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>In recent years, many scholarly journals have sought to make their published content
          freely available. Publishing electronically helps by reducing overhead costs inherent in
          the print publication model. Academic libraries have become increasingly involved in
          facilitating the production and publication of open access electronic journals. Such
          efforts at the Indiana University (IU) Libraries were undertaken in parallel by two
          separate units: the former Digital Library Program (which now includes the Digital
          Collections Services department) and the Scholarly Communication department. In 2006, the
          Digital Library Program began a collaborative project with the Department of History to
          digitize and TEI-encode 102 years of the <title level="j">Indiana Magazine of
            History</title>, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes quarterly issues
          focused on the history of Indiana and the Midwest. In 2007, the Libraries launched
          IUScholarWorks Repository, IU’s DSpace-based institutional repository supported by the
          Scholarly Communication department. A handful of journals leveraged this service to
          disseminate and preserve their articles, including <title level="j">The Medieval
            Review</title>, an electronic book reviews journal that has published primarily via
          email since 1993 and also encodes its articles in TEI. In 2008, IUScholarWorks Journals
          emerged as a sister service dedicated to the publication of open access journals built on
          the Open Journal Systems (OJS) platform.</p>
        <p>Developed by the Public Knowledge Project (PKP), OJS is a widely used, comprehensive
          open-source software platform that supports electronic journal publication, requiring only
          local server space and staff to maintain it. OJS supports two primary needs of the journal
          publication process: <list rend="inline ordered">
            <item>the editorial workflow, including organizing submissions, managing peer review,
              and various stages of editing; and</item>
            <item>providing access to journal content once it is published, whether it is open
              access or available for purchase</item>
          </list>. It allows articles to be published in a variety of formats, including PDF, HTML,
          and more recently XML. Using the XML Galley Plugin, a journal can upload an XSLT 1.0 file
          to transform XML article content in any markup schema into HTML on the fly for display on
          the site. In this manner, it is possible to use an XSLT file to convert TEI in OJS.</p>
        <p>This paper aims to define potentially reusable workflows for publishing TEI-encoded
          electronic journals on the OJS software platform through two case studies. Existing
          research details considerations for using TEI for encoding electronic journal content,
          migrating journals to the OJS platform, and migrating TEI projects, but fails to document
          the use of OJS for publishing TEI-encoded journals. Besides documenting the migration
          process and publication workflow for two electronic open access journals at Indiana
          University, this paper will offer practical considerations for using OJS for TEI-encoded
          electronic journal publications.</p>

        <head>Literature Review</head>
        <p>Recent studies have examined the migration of digital projects, and themes from the
          literature run parallel to open access journal migration efforts at Indiana University.
          Pertaining to large-scale migration efforts, Stein and Thompson (<ref target="#stein15"
            type="bibl">2015</ref>) investigated the motivations behind institutions migrating
          digital asset management (DAM) systems, using survey findings to uncover common reasons
          for migration and desired functionalities in these systems (<ref target="#stein15"
            type="bibl">Stein and Thompson 2015</ref>). The Text Encoding Initiative Task Force on
          SGML to XML Migration issued guidance for tools and techniques to use when migrating
          resources encoded in SGML to XML (<ref target="#bauman04" type="bibl">Bauman et al.
            2002</ref>). Concerning TEI projects at Indiana University, Dalmau, Hardesty, and
          Homenda presented about the challenges faced when performing large-scale TEI migrations
          while upgrading the underlying platform (<ref target="#homenda14" type="bibl">Homenda,
            Dalmau, and Hardesty 2014</ref>).</p>
        <p>Holmes and Romary examined the use of TEI to represent electronic journals. They
          identified the spectrum of file types used within electronic journal editorial and
          publication workflows, including DOC, PDF, HTML, and XML, and advocated for the
          development of a customization of the TEI schema specifically for encoding journal
          articles. They acknowledged the OJS editorial workflow but noted the platform’s
          limitations, including the need to produce and edit documents for publication on software
          outside of the system (<ref target="#holmes11" type="bibl">Holmes and Romary 2011</ref>).
          At that time, OJS was a relatively new platform that had minimal XML support and no means
          of handling TEI files directly. The <title level="j">Journal of the Text Encoding
            Initiative</title> has produced a highly constrained customization of TEI P5 (80 out of
          600 elements) in order to be able to publish its own journal articles (<ref
            target="#vdb14" type="bibl">Van den Branden and Holmes 2014</ref>). From the submitted
          TEI XML, the journal generates different outputs such as ODT for the editorial workflow,
          OpenEdition XML for the
          <!-- [RvdB] updated reference to revues.org  with journals.openedition.org -->journals.openedition.org
          publication platform, and a PDF, which requires conformity of submissions to the standard.
          There is a jTEI template for the Oxygen XML editor that makes encoding within the schema
          easier.</p>
        <p>A study by Dias, Delfino, and Silva investigated the feasibility of migrating electronic
          journals to OJS, and noted some of the advantages and shortcomings early in its life as an
          open source publishing platform (<ref target="#dias07" type="bibl">Dias, Delfino, and
            Silva 2007</ref>). Dalmau and Schlosser recognized that Indiana University’s
          IUScholarWorks Journals service began using OJS in a pilot project in 2008 after
          significant development of an alternate platform occurred.. They outlined the history of
          the <title level="a">Indiana Magazine of History</title>, the journal’s collaborative
          relationship with the IU Libraries, and the resulting accessible online index and the
          first iteration of its online open access platform (<ref target="#dalmau10" type="bibl"
            >Dalmau and Schlosser 2010</ref>). Their work focused on developing a TEI model for the
            <title level="j">Indiana Magazine of History</title> that featured issue-level encoding
          using the P4 version of the guidelines and independent header files for encoding
          article-level metadata.</p>

          <head>Project History</head>
          <p>Beginning in 2006, the Indiana University Digital Library Program (DLP) began a project
            funded by a Library Services and Technology Act grant to digitize the back issues of the
              <title level="j"><ref
                target="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/pages/view/projectinfo"

                <ptr
                target="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/pages/view/projectinfo"
              />.</note> encode the text using TEI, and deliver the page images and encoded text
            through an open access web application. Digitizing the journal entailed contracting an
            overseas vendor to scan the journal archives and deliver TIFF master files. Next, the
            DLP made JPEG, PDF, and OCR text derivative files from these TIFFs according to the
            content model for paged media in IU’s Fedora digital repository, where the derivative
            images were ingested. To prepare the journal for TEI encoding, optical character
            recognition (OCR) was used to produce plain-text files that were automatically placed
            into TEI files with bibliographic metadata in the header and page breaks inserted at the
            appropriate places. Back issues of <title level="j">IMH</title> were encoded during the
            project years 2006 to 2008, and newly released issues continue to be encoded by IU
            Libraries interns and student employees seeking to gain experience with TEI. Issues are
            made open access with a two-year embargo.</p>
          <p>The encoding workflow for this project was unique in that entire issues of the journal
            were encoded as single TEI documents with additional independent header files containing
            article-level metadata. Once issues and independent headers were initially encoded, they
            were subjected to quality control procedures involving markup inspection, additional
            validation, and visual inspection on a test server. After passing quality control, page
            image derivatives and TEI files were ingested into Fedora, and METS files were
            automatically generated for use by the DLP’s page-turning web application, <ref

            publishing an issue of <title level="j">IMH</title> took an additional couple of weeks
            because of the need for software developers to interact with the various components that
            made up the web application.</p>

          <head>System Limitations</head>
          <p>Although the various systems that comprised the <title level="j">IMH</title> online
            portal functioned stably and reliably, the amount of developer intervention required
            made it difficult to make new issues available quickly and even more difficult to make
            minor post-publication corrections. The underlying XTF platform natively supports XML
            collections and contains default stylesheets for TEI transformations; however, the level
            of customization needed to support the <title level="j">IMH</title> impeded quick
            publication and indexing by search engines. A single incorrect page number in a page
            break element, bibliographic metadata field, or METS file would result in the entire
            article’s text and page images becoming inaccessible. Since these files were stored in
            the Fedora repository with no web-based user interface, changes to any of the numerous
            file types associated with each article would require a software developer to manually
            replace files. In addition to the complexity associated with several interlocking
            systems, the online portal of <title level="j">IMH</title> also suffered from poor
            Google indexing: no individual articles appeared in Google search results, a problem
            that would require completely re-architecting the site to fix.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="IMH.migration">
          <head>Journal Migration</head>
          <p>Beginning in 2013, the Indiana University Libraries’ Digital Collections Services (DCS)
            department began investigating the feasibility of migrating <title level="j">IMH</title>
            to OJS. DCS interns analyzed the existing XTF publishing platform, noted gaps and
            weaknesses, and investigated the functionality available using the OJS platform. DCS
            broached the idea of a migration with <title level="j">IMH</title> staff and they
            indicated interest in transitioning to OJS to disseminate their open access issues, and
            possibly in exploring the use of OJS’s editorial workflow tools in the future.</p>
          <p>DCS and Scholarly Communication staff worked together to execute the migration of 7,000
              <title level="j">IMH</title> articles and to transition the journal’s operational
            support from DCS to the Scholarly Communication department. During this process, the P4
            TEI encoding was left unchanged; however, an article-level version of the encoding is
            required by OJS. Fortunately, the previous <title level="j">IMH</title> platform
            contained a TEI article export function, which was used to obtain all <title level="j"
              >IMH</title> articles for the migration. This function took issue-level TEI files and
            automatically converted them to the article-level TEI files required by OJS, using
            encoded text from the issue TEI and article metadata from the independent header files
            developed by Dalmau and Schlosser during the project’s initial iteration. This function
            had been implemented within the XTF publishing platform to provide readers the option to
            download single TEI files for research or analysis purposes.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="IMH.workflow">
          <head>Workflow Solutions</head>
          <p>In August 2014, a new workflow for publishing the <title level="j">IMH</title> online
            was implemented using OJS. The <title level="j">IMH</title> editors decided to continue
            conducting their peer review, editing, and typesetting processes outside of OJS. Once
            they release a new issue in print, they transfer PDF copies of the final, formatted
            files for each article to the library via <ref target="https://uits.iu.edu/box">IU
              Box</ref>.<note>Indiana University, Box @ IU, accessed January 8, 2018, <ptr
                target="https://uits.iu.edu/box"/>.</note> A Libraries intern or student employee
            copies and pastes the text of each article from the PDF into an article-level TEI
            template. They encode the article according to the local implementation guidelines
            established by the project in 2009 that were recently updated to reflect changes in
            encoding practices due to the journal’s migration. Most significantly, they no longer
            require the encoding of geographic places and personal names. Although this level of
            encoding was a key feature of the <title level="j">IMH</title> project, the originally
            proposed software features intended to leverage this encoding depth were never
            developed. Moreover, encoding these two components took the majority of the time spent
            on each issue, which further slowed down the publication timeline.</p>
          <p>Once the initial TEI encoding is complete, Libraries staff check each encoded file for
            quality and return it to the intern or student employee with any necessary changes. This
            process is repeated until the file contains no encoding errors. Libraries staff run a
            prepared XQuery file on the set of encoded files to read metadata expediently from all
            of the XML files and to compose the single XML import file with the issue and article
            bibliographic metadata required by OJS. The TEI article files are stored on a local
            server in a location that is referenced by the import file. Next, Libraries staff upload
            the import file into a development instance of OJS using the <soCalled>Articles &amp;
              Issues</soCalled> XML plugin. An XSLT file that is stored in the XML Galley plugin
            renders the TEI files automatically on the fly as HTML (<ptr type="crossref"
              target="#figure2"/>). Once the file is successfully imported into the development
            instance of OJS, it is saved locally for two years after the print publication date (in
            accordance with the journal’s two-year embargo period) when it is imported into the
            production instance of OJS and the content becomes open access.</p>

            The journal has had a long history of encoding articles in TEI, using P3 encoding from
            1993 to 2009. The encoding standard was updated to P4 in 2009 using an article-level
            model originally developed by the Digital Library program for the <title level="j"
              >Indiana Magazine of History</title>’s TEI article export function. At that time,
            however, the existing P3-encoded articles were not migrated to P4, which resulted in a
            corpus of TEI documents in both P3 and P4, making error correction and corpus-wide
            transformations problematic.</p>
          <p>The publishing workflow for <title level="j">TMR</title> relied on the use of a
            FileMaker Pro database built by the journal. The journal’s editorial assistant entered
            review articles into the database, which was also used to handle various aspects of the
            editorial workflow, including tracking books available for review, accepting incoming
            reviews, assigning editors, managing the revision process, publishing individual reviews
            via email, and exporting review articles as TEI XML. The editorial assistant placed
            exported files from the database into a drop box on a server managed by the Libraries. A
            script was then run each night to transform the files via XSLT and deposit them as HTML
            files into the IUScholarWorks institutional repository, which uses the <ref
              target="http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace</ref> open-source repository
              software.<note>Accessed January 8, 2018, <ptr target="http://www.dspace.org/"
              />.</note> The script also extracted metadata from the files to complete each deposit

          <p>DSpace was developed to serve as an institutional repository, which Clifford Lynch
              (<ref xml:id="quoteref1" target="#lynch03" type="bibl">2003, 2</ref>) describes as
              <quote source="#quoteref1"><gap/>a set of services that a university offers to the
              members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials
              created by the institution and its community members.</quote> Although some
            institutions have adapted DSpace to deliver digital collections, the software is not
            natively meant to support this: files stored in the repository are not viewable within
            the system and must be downloaded by users, and the visual styling of the repository is
            relatively inflexible across collections stored within.</p>
          <p>The process for publishing <title level="j">TMR</title> TEI was error-prone since
            incorrect encoding of metadata and text could result in skewed deposits in DSpace.
            Moreover, making updates to the XML files required developer intervention and an
            uncomfortably elastic approach to deleting and re-depositing that is normally not used
            in a secure institutional repository. Furthermore, the journal had little to no control
            over the appearance and functionality of the online portal or their articles, the latter
            of which were presented as downloadable HTML files with no styling and essentially
            appeared as plain text.</p>

          <head>Journal Migration</head>
          <p>In 2014, discussions with <title level="j">TMR</title> editors about the viability of
            migrating to OJS were sparked by a slew of problems the editors experienced in trying to
            correct errors in previously published articles. Although OJS provides an
              <soCalled>Objects for Review</soCalled> plugin (formerly the <soCalled>Books for
              Review</soCalled> plugin), it is not comprehensive enough to manage <title level="j"
              >TMR</title>’s complex editorial workflow. Therefore, <title level="j">TMR</title>
            editors were mainly interested in the features of OJS that provided a mechanism for
            publishing XML, enhanced indexability, and the ability to customize the appearance of
            the website. Before the journal accepted the terms of a migration to OJS, Libraries
            staff made prototype versions of <title level="j">TMR</title> in OJS and imported
            articles and issues for journal staff to examine (as was done with <title level="j"
              >IMH</title>).</p>
          <p>For <title level="j">TMR</title>, which had nearly 4,000 articles at the time, DCS
            staff decided to simplify the journal’s setup in OJS by migrating both P3 and P4
            articles to the current P5 markup in order to achieve consistency across the corpus. Had
            the encoding migration not been performed, the XSLT within the OJS XML Galley Plugin
            would have had to account for two different markup versions, and the P3 portion of the
            corpus would have had to be converted from SGML to XML. In addition, because the quality
            of the encoding was quite low in certain places, an item-by-item inspection was already
            necessary in order to correct significant metadata and encoding errors. These
            corrections were ultimately incorporated into the migration process to P5.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="TMR.workflow">
          <head>Workflow Solutions</head>
          <p><title level="j">TMR</title> began publishing in OJS using a new workflow in June 2015.
            Libraries staff worked with <title level="j">TMR</title>’s editorial staff to update
            their FileMaker Pro database export templates that conform and validate according to the
            TEI P5 Guidelines. Like the <title level="j">IMH</title> editors, <title level="j"
              >TMR</title> editors decided to continue conducting their review, editing, and email
            distribution processes outside of OJS. Now, when a new review is ready for online
            publication, a <title level="j">TMR</title> editorial assistant generates the TEI file
            from the FileMaker Pro database and enters the metadata for the article in the
              <soCalled>Quick Submit</soCalled> plugin in OJS (<ptr type="crossref"
              target="#figure4"/>). This plugin allows journal staff to upload and quickly publish a
            single article within the system without needing to utilize the system’s editorial
            workflow steps. <title level="j">TMR</title> staff use this plugin since they review and
            prepare their review articles within their own local database and need OJS to
            immediately publish the final versions of these articles without further editorial
            steps. Because the <soCalled>Quick Submit</soCalled> plugin is not currently compatible
            with XML files, it is not possible to upload the article file at this stage; the
            editorial assistant must edit the article after it has been created in OJS and attach
            the corresponding TEI file. The TEI file is then automatically rendered as HTML by an
            XSLT file (based on the one created for <title level="j">IMH</title>) that is stored in
            the <soCalled>XML Galley</soCalled> plugin.</p>

        <p>Common concerns about reliability, discoverability, and lack of control prompted the
          migration of these two journals to OJS. The custom platforms and workflows developed for
            <title level="j">IMH</title> and <title level="j">TMR</title> required developer time to
          perform routine tasks and were prone to breaking. Moreover, having a custom-coded solution
          makes future maintenance more difficult when staffing changes occur, a problem slightly
          mitigated but not solved by extensive project documentation. These platforms also employed
          less-than-adequate indexing architecture resulting in low discoverability by users outside
          of IU. Finally, while many scholarly journals lack the staff necessary to design and
          manage a complex online publishing system, they still hope for a certain level of control
          over their publishing platform, and they desire the ability to change the appearance of
          the site, correct errors in markup and metadata, and perform basic publishing actions with
          minimal overhead. The custom platforms for <title level="j">IMH</title> and <title
            level="j">TMR</title> did not allow this control.</p>
        <p>Both journals have benefited from using OJS as a publication platform. For <title
            level="j">IMH</title>, the time to publication has been significantly reduced; after the
          TEI files are reviewed for quality, it takes just five minutes to publish a new issue
          online, a process which used to take weeks. Moving <title level="j">IMH</title> to OJS
          also improved the visibility of its content; the site is now indexed by Google and
          individual articles are indexed by Google Scholar. From the Libraries’ perspective, moving
            <title level="j">IMH</title> under the umbrella of IUScholarWorks Journals has helped to
          consolidate library journal publishing activities under one roof. Similarly, moving <title
            level="j">TMR</title> from DSpace to OJS helped to consolidate all library-published
          open access journals within a single platform, making it easier to manage. This benefits
          journal staff, who now can receive a consistent level of publishing and technical support.
          Finally, OJS enables both <title level="j">IMH</title> and <title level="j">TMR</title>
          editors to have a greater amount of control over the appearance of their respective
          platforms. In the past, editors have had to ask library staff to make even the smallest of
          changes, which they can now accomplish themselves by logging in directly to OJS.</p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="recommendations">
        <head>Recommendations and Future Directions</head>
        <p>These two projects illustrate that while using XML to publish electronic journals is
          hardly a new idea, the technical complexity involved in designing highly customized
          publishing platforms makes them difficult and expensive to maintain. TEI’s flexibility
          makes it a good option for encoding journal content, but efficiently delivering this
          content requires an easy-to-use publication platform with minimal need for advanced
          software development skills and developer time.</p>
        <p>OJS may be a solution for active TEI-encoded serial publications in need of a new
          publication platform. As an existing tool with a large community of support, OJS
          eliminates the need to build and maintain a boutique publication platform. While it is
          specifically designed to accommodate journals, its use can easily be extended to other
          types of serial publications, such as monographic series and conference proceedings.
          Furthermore, it provides a user interface that enables non–technically savvy editorial
          staff to easily update the content of their journal website. OJS, however, has its
          limitations for publishing TEI projects: it cannot interact with the TEI in any other way
          than simply transforming it to a different output format. For example, it is not possible
          to create browse or search facets based on the encoding without making significant
          alterations to the core OJS code. These kinds of changes are not desirable, as they would
          make the process of upgrading the software much more challenging.</p>
        <p>While OJS has demonstrated itself to be a flexible, easy-to-use publication platform for
          TEI-based journals, there are several considerations to be made before adopting it
          locally. First, journal staff must decide on a workflow for generating the TEI and secure
          the staffing resources to implement it. Second, server space and the ability to install
          and maintain the software is needed. If batch uploading of article files is desired,
          additional, albeit minimal, server space is needed to serve as a temporary holding place
          to facilitate this process.</p>
        <p>As demonstrated through the case studies of <title level="j">IMH</title> and <title
            level="j">TMR</title>, XML publishing in OJS is by no means seamless. Fortunately, the
          PKP team is actively developing improvements in this area. The organization is currently
          focused on converting Word documents to Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) XML, which can
          subsequently be converted to a variety of other formats including HTML and PDF. The PKP
          team is also working to perfect the <ref target="http://pkp-udev.lib.sfu.ca/">Open
            Typesetting Stack</ref> (previously the XML Parsing Service),<note>Accessed January 8,
            2018, <ptr target="http://pkp-udev.lib.sfu.ca/"/>.</note> a collection of different
          software libraries that perform various steps in the conversion process. An <ref
            target="https://github.com/pkp/ojs-markup/tree/master/docs">OJS plugin</ref> that
          submits documents to the Parsing Service is currently available on Github,<note>OJS
            Document Markup Plugin, accessed January 8, 2018, <ptr
              target="https://github.com/pkp/ojs-markup/tree/master/docs"/>.</note> but it has not
          yet been integrated into the main software code. PKP’s efforts towards parsing
          minimally-structured text into XML could enable additional encoding standards and schemas
          to be used more easily within the platform, especially because the project is open source.
          Whether journals prefer to use JATS, TEI, or some other standard to encode their content,
          OJS as a platform is unlikely to influence the adoption of one XML standard over another,
          since their plugins and workflows have been built with a high degree of flexibility and
          the potential for customization to support individual journal needs.</p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="conclusion">
        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>While TEI remains a viable option among XML journal publishing schemas, the technical
          challenges associated with managing the publication process are daunting to many journal
          publishers. At Indiana University, the successful migration of two TEI-based journals to
          the OJS platform has provided a model for supporting journals that have developed or are
          interested in developing an XML publishing workflow. These projects have also helped the
          Libraries to forge closer working relationships among their DCS and Scholarly
          Communication departments, and to strengthen their collective expertise in the realm of
          digital publishing. The cases of <title level="j">IMH</title> and <title level="j"
            >TMR</title> demonstrate OJS’s ability to facilitate the publication of TEI-encoded
          journals, both of which previously relied upon complex platforms and workflows that
          required a high level of technical skill to manage and maintain. More importantly, these
          examples open the door for current or future journals to consider using this platform with
          an XML- or TEI-encoding workflow.</p>
