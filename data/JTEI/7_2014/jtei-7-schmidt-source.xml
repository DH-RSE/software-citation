        <p>Recent proposals for creating digital scholarly editions (DSEs) through the crowdsourcing
          of transcriptions and collaborative scholarship, for the establishment of national
          repositories of digital humanities data, and for the referencing, sharing, and storage of
          DSEs, have underlined the need for greater data interoperability. The TEI Guidelines have
          tried to establish standards for encoding transcriptions since 1988. However, because the
          choice of tags is guided by human interpretation, TEI-XML encoded files are in general not
          interoperable. One way to fix this problem may be to break down the current all-in-one
          approach to encoding so that DSEs can be specified instead by a bundle of separate
          resources that together offer greater interoperability: plain text versions, markup,
          annotations, and metadata. This would facilitate not only the development of more general
          software for handling DSEs, but also enable existing programs that already handle these
          kinds of data to function more efficiently.</p>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>The Text Encoding Initiative has sought to define a <quote source="#quoteref1">standard
            or normalized practice</quote> (<ref type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref1" target="#ide88">Ide
            et al. 1988</ref>) for the encoding of a variety of text types since 1988, focusing on a
          uniform encoding format (SGML, later XML) and a recommended set of tag and attribute
          names. Although the purpose of the TEI Guidelines (<ref type="bibl" target="#tei14">TEI
            Consortium 2014</ref>) is to provide a general encoding scheme for texts of all types,
          its main applications to date have been in the field of historical literary and
          documentary texts. Of the 158 projects listed as using the Guidelines on the <ref
            target="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/">TEI website</ref>,<note><p><title
                level="a">Projects Using the TEI</title>, accessed February 13, 2014 <ptr
                target="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/"/>.</p></note> 123 fall into this
          category. TEI-encoded texts thus often form an important part of a digital scholarly
          edition (DSE), which may be defined as the modeling in the digital medium of the scholarâ€™s
          interactions with the text. This naturally includes much more than mere transcriptions:
          exegetic commentary, textual notes, contextual information in the form of biographies and
          other personal data, facsimile images of manuscripts and books, as well as functionalities
          such as the ability to annotate, select versions, and compare transcribed text with the
          originals (<ref type="bibl" target="#gabler10">Gabler 2010</ref>). But the encoded
          transcriptions of the original sources form the crux of it: they are the things upon which
          all this depends.</p>
        <p>The change in context between the pre-Web world of 1988, its isolated microcomputers and
          CD-ROMs, and the modern connected, mobile world of Web 2.0 is stark. Texts now have a
          different purpose: they need to be much more than simply exchangeable via disk or email,
          they need to instantly respond to heterogenous needs. Inevitably, this has resulted in a
          growing discontent with traditional approaches to encoding one-off literary and historical
          documentary texts (<ref type="bibl" target="#mueller13">Mueller 2013</ref>; <ref
            type="bibl" target="#robinson10">Robinson 2010</ref>). This discontent has focused on
          the size of the TEI Guidelines (currently 553 tags), the consequent difficulty of
          comprehending it enough to use it (<ref type="bibl" target="#usdin09">Usdin 2009</ref>),
          and its inability to elegantly represent overlapping structures that are common in
          born-material texts (<ref type="bibl" target="#renear93">Renear, Mylonas, and Durand
            1993</ref>). But arguably the most serious problem, now generally recognized (<ref
            type="bibl" target="#unsworth11">Unsworth 2011</ref>; <ref type="bibl"
            target="#bauman11">Bauman 2011</ref>), is that TEI-encoded texts are not interoperable:
          that is, they cannot be fully used in various applications without preliminary, and often
          substantial, conversion.</p>
        <p>The Web 2.0 world takes such interoperability for granted. No one is surprised by Word
          documents that load (almost) flawlessly into Google Docs, or by the possibility of editing
          image files produced in various formats by others, or by the mundane (but still amazing)
          fact that every Web page is readable in a variety of browsers, on a variety of devices, or
          that the complex interactivity of those pages works in each such environment. But all of
          these things did not happen by chance; they had to be engineered to work that way.</p>
        <p>These forces of change have also affected the digital humanities. It has been argued that
          much of the recent growth in the field is precisely due to the increasing use of social
          networks and in the rise of mobile and interactive use of data at the expense of older
          static forms (<ref type="bibl" target="#jones14">Jones 2014</ref>). Recent developments in
          the construction of international and national repositories of humanities texts (<ref

          crowd-sourcing (<ref type="bibl" target="#causer12">Causer, Tonra, and Wallace

          construct DSEs by contributions from geographically dispersed scholars (<ref type="bibl"
            xml:id="quoteref2" target="#crompton12">Crompton and Siemens 2012</ref>), have all
          underlined the importance of interoperability. Another area where digital scholarly
          editions need to work better together is in providing a stable means for parts of editions
          to be referred to (<ref type="bibl" target="#blackwell12">Blackwell and Smith 2012</ref>),
          and for the software supporting those references to interact with various applications
          over time.</p>
        <p>So what can be done to make these digital <soCalled>surrogates</soCalled> of culturally
          important texts more generally amenable to scholarly processes? How can software be built
          that successfully models the former interactions of scholars with the print edition: the
          ability to compare, annotate, find, reference, catalog, edit, and study texts? And how can
          these operations be shared effectively? If all these processes are now to be remodeled in
          the digital medium, the thing on which they operate, like the printed book before it, must
          itself be an interoperable object. One way to achieve this may be to separate out the
          different kinds of information currently stored in the same file format. TEI-encoded data
          falls naturally into four classes: <list rend="inline">
            <item>markup,</item>
            <item>annotation,</item>
            <item>metadata, and</item>
            <item>plain text versions</item>
          </list>. It is no accident that these four classes correspond to the forms of data
          expected by modern applications. For example, metadata is now mostly stored separately
          from the texts it describes in repositories such as <ref
            target="http://www.fedora-commons.org">Fedora</ref><note><p><ptr
                target="http://www.fedora-commons.org"/>.</p></note> or <ref
            target="http://www.dspace.org/">Dspace</ref>,<note><p><ptr
                target="http://www.dspace.org/"/>.</p></note> not embedded in a TEI header.
          Annotations are also external, as in the <ref
            target="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/">Open Annotation Data
              Model</ref>,<note><p>Last revised February 8, 2013, <ptr
                target="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/"/>.</p></note> not embedded in the
          same text they describe. Markup systems like XML and SGML were originally designed to
          format linear text (<ref type="bibl" target="#goldfarb96">Goldfarb 1996</ref>), not to
          represent variations in the very information they are describing. Separating out markup
          from text and splitting texts into their variant components would thus clarify their
          respective roles in the digital scholarly edition. Plain text is also the most widely
          supported format for text analysis. Of the 54 current text analysis tools listed on the
            <ref
            target="https://digitalresearchtools.pbworks.com/w/page/17801708/Text%20Analysis%20Tools"

        <p>The rest of this paper treats each of these points in more detail. <ptr type="crossref"
            target="#interoperability"/> describes the nature of the interoperability problem. <ptr

          separately from the text it describes. <ptr type="crossref" target="#metaannotations"/>
          looks at metadata and annotation, and how it also benefits the overall scheme of
            <soCalled>big tent</soCalled> humanities to record it outside of transcriptions. <ptr

          the benefits of this approach.</p>

        <head>Interoperability and the TEI Guidelines</head>
        <p><term>Interoperability</term> may be defined as the property of data that allows it to be
          loaded <emph>unmodified</emph> and fully used in a <emph>variety</emph> of software
          applications. <term>Interchange</term> is basically the same property that applies after a
          preliminary conversion of the data (<ref type="bibl" target="#bauman11">Bauman 2011</ref>;
            <ref type="bibl" target="#unsworth11">Unsworth 2011</ref>), and implies some loss of
          information in the process. Interchange can thus be seen as an easier, less stringent, or
          less useful kind of information exchange than pure interoperability.</p>
        <p>From its inception, the TEI Guidelines were conceived as a format for interchange,
          specifically to overcome the then prevalent use of multiple character encoding standards
          in 1987. But it is clear from the original grant proposal (<ref type="bibl"
            target="#ide88">Ide et al. 1988</ref>), and from the Poughkeepsie principles drawn up
          after the inaugural TEI conference in 1987 (<ref type="bibl" target="#tei88">TEI
            Consortium 1988</ref>), that the TEI was also conceived as an interchange format based
          on standardized tags that would eventually form the basis of an interoperable format for
          the writing of <emph>shared</emph> software: <cit>
            <quote source="#quoteref3">If a common encoding scheme existed <gap/> the materials
              created by these projects would be in a uniform format <gap/> Even more important, we
              can assume that the existence of a common format will prompt software developers to
              accommodate this format.<gap/> Therefore, the materials created by projects over the
              next decade could serve as input to as-yet undeveloped software designed for any
              number of text analytic tasks. If both the creators of textual scholarly materials and
              software developers utilize a common encoding format, the texts may be used with any
              software package.</quote>
            <ref type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref3" target="#ide88">Ide et al. 1988, 1.4</ref>
          </cit>
        </p>
        <p>Whatever this meant at the time, Syd Bauman (<ref type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref4"
            target="#bauman11">2011</ref>), one of the original editors of TEI P5, has since
          observed that interoperability of TEI-encoded texts todayâ€”that is, the exchange of
          unmodified TEI files between different programsâ€”is <quote source="#quoteref4"
            >impossible</quote>. Bauman is more optimistic about interchange, but he admits that
          interchange remains <quote source="#quoteref4">difficult</quote> and that it involves
          considerable human intervention. Martin Mueller, as chairman of the TEI Board, remarked
          that in his experience, detailed TEI markup is generally ignored in practical
          applications, and currently offers no advantage over plain text, HTML or ePub formats
            (<ref type="bibl" target="#mueller11">2011, 5</ref>). A recently published report on
          Project Bamboo likewise described the stripping out of all TEI encoding so that texts
          gathered from various sources could be made to interoperate (<ref type="bibl"
            target="#dombrowski13">Dombrowski and Denbo 2013</ref>). As John Unsworth (<ref
            type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref5" target="#unsworth11">2011</ref>) says: <quote
            source="#quoteref5">The <mentioned>I</mentioned> in TEI sometimes stands for
            interchange, but it never stands for interoperability</quote>.</p>
        <p>These express admissions by those involved closely with the TEI seem at odds with the
          user communityâ€™s needs for standardization and interoperability that gave rise to the TEI
          in the first place (<ref type="bibl" target="#cummings07">Cummings 2007, Â§4</ref>). The
          interpretive data contained in the tags is instead locked up in specific projects or
            <quote source="#quoteref6">digital islands</quote> (<ref type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref6"
            target="#robinson10">Robinson 2010, 158</ref>) that are of little use to the wider
          community of scholars. As Martin Mueller asks: <quote source="#quoteref7">What about the
            added value of TEI specific encoding for the historian, linguist, philosopher, literary
            critic etc.? How can they decode or get at it, and what does it do for them? The answer
            is that for the most part they cannot get at it at all.</quote> (<ref type="bibl"
            xml:id="quoteref7" target="#mueller11">2011, 5</ref>)</p>
        <p>To those involved in the creation of digital scholarly editions, interoperability seems
          to matter a great deal. The whole point of the large European Interedition project was to
          create <quote source="#quoteref8">an interoperable supranational infrastructure for
            digital editions.</quote><note><p><bibl xml:id="quoteref8"><title level="m">An

                />.</bibl></p></note> Likewise, one of Peter Robinsonâ€™s five desiderata for
          scholarly digital editions was that <quote source="#quoteref9">all the materials in a
            digital edition should be available independent of any one interface</quote> (<ref
            type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref9" target="#robinson13">Robinson 2013</ref>). In a similar
          vein Dot Porter writes: <quote source="#quoteref10">Notably, from 1992 through today, the
            papers, sessions, and workshops at the Congress that focus on digital editing focus on
            the creation of those editions, but there is very little if anything to be found on how
            those editions might be used by the scholarly community</quote> (<ref type="bibl"
            xml:id="quoteref10" target="#porter13">Porter 2013</ref>). Or as Maria MorrÃ¡s puts it:
            <quote source="#quoteref11">I doubt much that there will ever exist definitive computer
            programs, or even a stable format for presenting and connecting texts in hypermedia
            archives.<gap/> It is essential that texts are transcribed in accordance with a
            universal system which enables the transference from one program to another

            235</ref>â€”my translation). Indeed, if sharing of edition data stored in repositories,
          and collaboration on their preparation by contributors across the world, is to happen at
          all, it seems clear that the required benchmark is data <emph>interoperability</emph>, not
          mere data interchange. As Martin Mueller complains, <quote source="#quoteref12">the TEI
            keeps insisting on a distinction between <term>interoperability</term> and

          <head>The TEI Paradox</head>
          <p>And here is the paradox for the modern digital humanist who works with transcriptions
            of the textual content of original artifacts. Everyone knows that XML itself, the base
            technology for the TEI Guidelines, is a highly interoperable format. No one is disputing
            that there are many applications able to understand XML, such as Apache Cocoon, XML
            parsers, XQuery, oXygen, XSLT processors, etc. Valid XML data can be loaded unmodified
            into such applications and can be successfully parsed, merged, edited, searched, and
            transformed. But in spite of these properties of XML itself, information encoded at the
            TEI level, at the <soCalled>tag</soCalled> level, is mostly <emph>not</emph>
            interoperable, for reasons first explained most cogently by Alan Renear (<ref
              type="bibl" target="#renear00">2000</ref>). Renear argued that there is an important
            distinction to be drawn between <list rend="ordered">
              <item>a title tag inserted by the transcriber of a physical document as an
                interpretation of what he/she sees (but it may not be true), and</item>
              <item>the same tag used by an author to declare that his/her digital text is in fact a
                title.</item>
            </list> TEI tags are usually of type 1, because they are the result of human
            interpretation. Most other XML tags, however, are of type 2.</p>
          <p>Renear characterizes the distinction as one of mood. Type 1 corresponds to the
            indicative mood, and type 2 to the imperative, where the author of the text is
            effectively issuing the command: <q>be a title!</q> Markup is so often created in
            situation 2 that one can easily be tricked into thinking that it is always so. For
            example, markup generated by a machine is easy for another machine to read. All that is
            needed is to reverse the algorithm that wrote it. An example using the TEI Guidelines
            would be an XML text generated by a natural language parser. Such XML files
              <emph>may</emph> be interoperable, if standardized, because they are part of a
            machine-to-machine conversation. Even a program that translates objects created by
            humans using a GUI interface, such as a drawing program or a word-processor, can save
            the result in an interoperable format because it is the <emph>program</emph> that reads
            and writes the tags, not the human. An example of such a format is SVG (Scalable Vector
            Graphics), which is an XML format. Drawings saved in <ref
              target="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</ref><note><p>Scalable Vector Graphics,
                  <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/"/>.</p></note> can be rendered and
            edited in a variety of programs. Even when a human creates a file in HTML the result is
            usually interoperable because all the tags created are of type 2. But when a humanist
            transcribes original historical documents, such as the contents of a printed novel, the
            result is markup that is <emph>not</emph> interoperable because what is guiding the
            selection and application of the tags is a human brain, and every step the human takes
            is an interpretation of type 1.</p>
          <p>Patrick Durusau illustrates the significance of this distinction with a practical
            example. He enumerates more than <emph>four million ways</emph> to encode a simple
            sentence taken from a printed book using the TEI Guidelines. And this huge figure <quote
              source="#quoteref13">is by no means exhaustive</quote>. This illustrates, as he says,
              <quote source="#quoteref13">the unlikelihood that any two encoders or even the same
              encoder on different days will make, without formal guidance, the same
              decisions</quote> (<ref type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref13" target="#durusau06">Durusau
              2006, 302</ref>). Durusau argues that this demonstrates the importance of documenting
            encoding choices, of modeling texts in advance, of training encoders, checking syntax,
            and reviewing transcriptions. Although all these measures taken together will probably
            prove effective, the author knows from the experience of having worked for more than ten
            years on the Vienna Edition of Wittgenstein that these methods are very costly to
            implement, and in cases where the contributors to a project are from different
            geographical locations, they are probably also hard to enforce.</p>
          <p>The reason behind this difficulty is the nature of being human: everyone sees different
            features when they look at the same text in a manuscript. And everyone understands the
            meaning of the tags to which they must map those features differently. It is easy to
            make texts syntactically correct, even conform grammatically to a given markup scheme,
            but one also must ask, are they internally <emph>consistent</emph>, and can they be
              <emph>kept</emph> in that state in the face of continued editing? As Tommie Usdin
              (<ref type="bibl" target="#usdin02">2002</ref>) points out, having more than one way
            to encode the same thing increases choice but does not make things any easier; in fact
            it <emph>magnifies</emph> the work of encoding.</p>

          <p>If Renear is right, then it is the <term>illocutionary force</term> of TEI markup as

          <p>Another real-world example is the interesting experiment undertaken by Dombrowski and

              service engine to transform XML-marked up bibliographic entries into HTML</quote>.
            Unlike markup for literary documents, the TEI tags for marking up bibliographies are
            relatively constrained. The project was planned to take three weeks. In the end it took
            a year and involved a considerable amount of manual data and stylesheet manipulation: <cit>
              <quote source="#quoteref17">This revealed markup inconsistencies within the
                TEI-encoded data (such as the ordering of authorsâ€™ first and last names), which
                Hooper then revised. The revised TEI, in turn, brought to light legitimate variation
                in the data that the XSLT stylesheets did not correctly account for. In this way,
                both the data and the stylesheets underwent iterative development for a number of
                months.</quote>
              <ref type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref17" target="#dombrowski13">Dombrowski and Denbo

            </cit> This demonstrates the difference between interchange and interoperability. If the
            files had been in an interoperable format in the first place they could have been
            ingested and processed immediately.</p>
          <p>Another, more subtle example is the experiment in interpretative encoding conducted by
            Kate Singer (<ref type="bibl" target="#singer13">2013</ref>). When her students marked
            up the same poem using TEI tags for different tropes, each group of students ended up
            recording very different features in the same text, and at the end of the experiment it
            became clear that all their work had been frozen in their individual copies: <cit>
              <quote source="#quoteref18">my students began to dream of an interface that allowed
                them to bring our classâ€™s particular collections of text and commentary to bear on a

                versions in the space of the same edition.</quote>
              <ref type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref18" target="#singer13">Singer 2013</ref>
            </cit> The poetic tropes recorded by embedding markup tags in the texts they described
            had led to a form of non-interoperability: it prevented them from sharing their
            interpretations with other future students, or from collaborating with other current
            groups.</p>

            which contains 4.7 million words, and has been morphologically tagged, but the material

            One may well ask the question, what is the point of digitizing all these texts if the
            end result will not be reusable for a variety of purposes? Repurposing a text that has
            already been marked up for one application should not mean that it must be re-digitized
            or undergo a time-consuming conversion, possibly damaging the underlying content in the
            process. The tags for linguistic corpora have little in common with those used for
            literary texts, but often the underlying material is shared between them. The next few
            sections will examine how and why digitized texts should be prepared from the start with
            such re-use already in mind.</p>

      <div xml:id="removingmarkup">
        <head>Removing Markup from the Text</head>
        <p>One obvious remedy to this problem is to remove the main source of non-interoperability,
          namely the embedded markup itself, from the text. By removing it, the part which contains
          all the significant interpretation can later be added or substituted at will.</p>
        <p>What remains when the markup is removed is a residue of plain text that is highly
          interoperable, which can be exchanged with other researchers, just as the files on
          Gutenberg.org are downloaded by the tens of thousands every day (<ref type="bibl"
            target="#leibert08">Leibert 2008</ref>). However, if one suggests this to someone who
          regularly uses TEI-XML, the immediate objection is made that this will solve nothing,
          because even plain ASCII texts are still an interpretation of what the transcriber sees on
          the page (e.g. <ref type="bibl" target="#msmq91">Sperberg-McQueen 1991, 35</ref>). This
          point, although valid to a degree, misses an important distinction.</p>
        <p>But first consider what exactly is the nature of the interpretation exercised when a text
          is transcribed. A digital text encoding system, even one as expansive as Unicode, has a
          limited power to capture the features of abstract <soCalled>text</soCalled>, which may be
          understood as the entire content of a page to be transcribed (<ref type="bibl"
            target="#sahle13">Sahle 2013, 244</ref>). Certainly there is much that cannot be
          represented directly in this way: for example, unconventional characters found in
          manuscripts and early printed books, including abbreviations.<note><p>Medieval Unicode
              Font Initiative, <ptr target="http://www.mufi.info/"/>.</p></note> Many of these cases
          are ligatures, which can be encoded in their decomposed forms. Unicode is <quote
            source="#quoteref20">a <emph>character</emph> encoding standard, and is not intended to
            standardize ligatures or other presentation forms</quote> (<ref type="bibl"
            xml:id="quoteref20" target="#unicode10">Unicode 2010</ref>). For example, there is no
          Unicode character for old Latin <mentioned>sescuncia</mentioned> (like a pound-sign, means
            <soCalled>one eighth</soCalled>), since it can be composed from
            <mentioned>semuncia</mentioned> (character 10192) and an EN-dash (<ref type="bibl"
            target="#perry06">Perry 2006, 4</ref>). However, even in modern texts there are inline
          mathematics and graphics, which pose a similar problem. In such cases markup must be used
          to extend the capabilities of plain text. But let these exceptions be set aside for the
          moment, because the discussion on markup below also applies to them. Encodable character
          data or <soCalled>plain text</soCalled> is so overwhelmingly prevalent in literary and
          historical documents that it should be treated as a separate case.</p>
        <p>An encodable character on a page is either illegible, unclear, or clear. If the character
          is simply illegible, then a gap, qualified by some markup describing how long it is and
          how it has been rendered illegible can be added (<ref type="bibl" target="#tei14">TEI
            Consortium 2014, 3.4.3</ref>). If the letter is not clear then it admits of several
          various readings. It is thus like a variant and can be treated by the mechanisms for
          recording variants. But in by far the most common case, if the character symbol is clear
          and the letter has, say, the shape of the letter <mentioned>t</mentioned>, choosing to
          encode it as the Unicode character code 116 for <mentioned>t</mentioned> is probably not
          an interpretation, because no reasonable person would dispute the point. On the other
          hand, choosing to record it or not <emph>is</emph> an interpretation. Patrick Sahle (<ref
            type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref21" target="#sahle13">2013, 244f</ref>) argues in his <quote
            source="#quoteref21">pluralistic text model</quote> that different texts will be needed
          for different purposes. For instance, whether or not to encode the running header, or the
          index at the back, or the text in an image, would be an editorial decision. This
          interpretation is binary in nature: the editor can only choose to encode it or not.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the interpretation about which format or logical structure an
          italicized <mentioned>t</mentioned> belongs to involves assigning it to one of a myriad of
          possible encodings. In the TEI-Lite schema alone one may choose, for example, between
            <tag>hi rend="italic"</tag>, <tag>hi rend="italics"</tag>, <gi>foreign</gi>,
            <gi>stage</gi>, <gi>term</gi>, <gi>soCalled</gi>, and <gi>head</gi>. The problem with
          choosing one formulation of <soCalled>italics</soCalled> or another and inserting it into
          the text is that this constitutes a declaration of intent to write software that will act
          upon those specific interpretative codes. Even just encoding it in any kind of XML
          declares an intent to process it in an XML-aware application. Encoding it in a specific
          customization of TEI-XML presupposes that there is software that can understand that
          encoding, including its interpretation of the TEI Guidelines, which specifies how the
          chosen attributes and tags should be applied to the text in question.</p>
        <p>Encoding a text in Unicode is also admittedly a declaration of intent to process it in a
          Unicode-aware application, but programs that understand the Unicode character encoding are
          now practically universal.</p>
        <p>To achieve interoperabilityâ€”the ability to load a transcription into various programs
          without modificationâ€”it is thus obvious that the markup must first be removed from the
          text, because it is the markup that contains virtually all of the interpretation, and what
          little interpretation remains does not stop the text from being interoperable.</p>
        <p>Admittedly, there are many features recorded in markup that are really part of the
            <soCalled>text</soCalled> and vice-versa, such as tabs, spaces, and
          carriage-returnsâ€”which are, at least in part, layout instructions found in plain textâ€”and
          paragraph breaks, which are a kind of text content described via markup. However, since
          interoperability is a technological property (the ability to load a file unmodified into
          several programs), the distinction must be drawn on technological grounds. There are
          simply too many ways to mark things that might be interpreted as paragraph breaksâ€”for
          example, <gi>div</gi>, <gi>ab</gi>, <gi>sp</gi>,â€”for any combination of text plus basic
          markup to serve as an interoperable format.</p>

            the design of a practical web-based editing system that could be assembled using

            environment for XML or a Markdown-like language (adapted for TEI). The latter are now
            ubiquitous on the Web and have the advantage of offering a forgiving
                  syntax.<note><p><ptr target="http://www.markdownviewer.com/"/>.</p></note> Rather
            than parsing the user-input formally, they convert it into approximate HTML, then
              <soCalled>tidy</soCalled> it into valid HTML. The user can thus see the result
            immediately without receiving any puzzling <q>syntax error</q> messages. When the user
            presses <mentioned>save</mentioned> the client sends to the server the HTML or XML
            (depending on the interface), which is immediately stripped of markup, and the two
            components are stored separately.</p>
          <p>Only one editorial layer or internal version of the document can be edited at a time.
            If there are other stand-off markup sets attached to this version they could be updated
            on save, by first computing the differences between the submitted copy and the one
            stored on the server. These differences could then be used to delete, curtail or expand
            the range of existing markup properties (<ref type="bibl" target="#nelson97">Nelson
              1997</ref>; <ref type="bibl" target="#vulpe98">Vulpe and Owens 1998</ref>). The user
            would be entirely unaware that there were any stand-off properties attached to the text;
            the formatting would appear naturally inline, but the benefits of the separation would
            always be present in the system. In this form the text+markup can be saved as a coherent
            copy through export, or reformatted for another purpose using a different markup set or
            sets. The ability to convert stand-off properties into valid HTML already exists in the
            formatter tool in <ref target="http://austese.net/">AustESE</ref>.<note><p>Australian
                Electronic Scholarly Editing, <ptr target="http://austese.net/"/>.</p></note> This
            could easily be extended to generate Markdown or XML. When the user requests that
            version again, the digital document is reconstructed from the stand-off markup
            properties and the base text and a new XML or Markdown document is created for editing.
            This data flow has the advantage of silently fixing any coding errors present in the
            userâ€™s input, and painlessly enforcing the correct coding syntax.</p>

          of data that describes digital resources on the Web. But in the context of TEI, metadata
          means data describing the digital document as a whole, and in TEI it
          <!-- [RvdB] metadata: singular/plural? -->is embodied in the Header, which is an
          obligatory part of every TEI document. (In this section <term>document</term> refers to
          the digital surrogate, not the physical document.) The problem with embedded metadata is
          that they are not interoperable. The more common approach now is to store metadata
          separately from the documents they describe (<ref type="bibl" target="#haynes04">Haynes
            2004, 107</ref>). The increasing tendency toward user-driven data models for repository
          design, inspired by the growth of cultural resources websites, has fueled the development
          of cross-disciplinary repositories and increased demand for interoperability of metadata
            (<ref type="bibl" target="#spinazzÃ¨04">SpinazzÃ¨ 2004</ref>). This has led to two basic
          strategies: <list rend="ordered">
            <item><p>Federation of existing metadata formats by specifying a translation of metadata
                properties between formats.</p></item>
            <item><p>Reduction of the metadata to the lowest common denominator across the whole
                collection. The most common format used for this purpose is <ref

                  />.</p></note> as used in DSpace, or even the more reductionist approach used in
                TextGrid.</p></item>
          </list>
        </p>
        <p>Since the advent of <soCalled>big tent</soCalled> humanities the digital scholarly
          edition has had to contemplate a future within a mixture of resources (images, video,
          audio, or other document types) from related disciplines like archaeology, sociology,
          history, philosophy, and art history. Functionally, if metadata about a document is not
          available in a separate database, retrieval is complicated and slow. This means that
          either the TEI header has to be extracted and transformed into the repository standard
          metadata, or generated and inserted into the document, based on the repository metadata.
          Either way, the TEI header looks increasingly as if it is redundant in its present
          form.</p>
        <p>The primary uses of metadata are to describe resources and to aid in their discovery
            (<ref type="bibl" target="#day01">Day 2001</ref>). But metadata also play a role in
          management and description of a resource. Once the resource is found, it would help the
          user to know more about it. But here the main problem is cost: detailed metadata are
          expensive to produce. So two forcesâ€”cost and the need for interoperabilityâ€”are both
          pushing towards external, brief, and standard metadata. The TEIHeader, on the other hand,
          is embedded, detailed, and non-standard.</p>
        <p>One quarter of the TEI Guidelines are dedicated to metadata. Part of the bulk comes from
          the specialized manuscript description module (<ident>msdescription</ident>). This can be
          part of the TEIHeader, or it can be used as a separate document format. Apart from this
          module, the TEIHeader itself mostly contains tags that are already provided by other
          metadata schemas, such as <ref target="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/"
              >MODS</ref>,<note><p>Metadata Object Description Schema, <ptr
                target="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/"/>.</p></note> Dublin Core, and <ref
            target="http://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/index.html">EAD</ref>,<note><p>Encoded Archival
              Description Tag Library, version 2002, EAD Technical Document no. 2, <ptr
                target="http://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/index.html"/>.</p></note> which is a
          serviceable substitute for TEIHeader. Removing it altogether, and storing the information
          externally, would significantly reduce the complexity of the TEI Guidelines without
          harming its usefulness. Applications that need <ident>msdescription</ident> could simply
          connect the separate manuscript descriptions to the source texts, using standard
          metadata.</p>
        <div xml:id="annotations">
          <head>Annotations</head>
          <p>Embedded annotations can also be removed from TEI texts. The elements <gi>note</gi>,
              <gi>interp</gi>, and <gi>interpGrp</gi> describe content that, like metadata, is
              <emph>about</emph> the text, not the text itself. These are really annotations, and
            should ideally be represented via the established standards and practices of
              <emph>external</emph> annotation (<ref type="bibl" target="#hunter12">Hunter and
              Gerber 2012</ref>). Annotations are stored in <term>triple stores</term> or graph
            databases like <ref target="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4J</ref>,<note><p><ptr
                  target="http://www.neo4j.org/"/></p></note> which record the identifiers of each
            component of the annotation and its data. Keeping track of how all these objects
            interrelate is a specialized task that should be assigned to a dedicated annotation
            engine. And annotation should point to the document, not the other way around.
            Otherwise, any alteration to the annotations will break the document. Strangely, the
              <gi>interp</gi> element in TEI does exactly that: it is assigned an <ident>id</ident>,
            and then the textual element <emph>points to it</emph> via its <att>ana</att> attribute.
            A similar awkwardness can be seen with <gi>span</gi>, which can be used similarly to
            embed short annotations directly in the text. The problems this caused for Singerâ€™s
            students have already been noted in <ptr target="#examples" type="crossref"/> above. As
            with metadata, the TEI mechanisms for annotation need to be brought more into line with
            modern practice.</p>

              Walsh, 4 May 2010.</p></note> This section will argue and demonstrate that it is in
          fact far more trouble than five minutesâ€™ work, and that there is no guarantee, even after
          several weeks of programming, that one may obtain consistent results for TEI files that
          use any form of variant encoding, including abbreviation and expansion and spelling
          normalization (i.e. <gi>mod</gi>, <gi>subst</gi>, <gi>choice</gi>, <gi>sic</gi>,
            <gi>corr</gi>, <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi>, <gi>abbr</gi>, <gi>expan</gi>, <gi>orig</gi>,
            <gi>reg</gi>, <gi>app</gi>, <gi>lem</gi>, and <gi>rdg</gi>). Tags are stripped from XML
          far more often than might be imagined. Whenever a program compares the content (not just
          the structure) of one XML file with another, whenever it analyzes the text content of a
          file, what the program sees is effectively the digital document stripped of all its tags.
          The example chosen for this demonstration is the poem <title level="a">Social
            Charity</title> from manuscript C376 by Charles Harpur, one of the first Australian
          poets. This documentary version dates to 1851, but there are four others extant, dating
          from 1848 to 1867. Consider the following half-page of MS C376:<note><p>The Sydney

          </figure> This is likely to be what a text-analysis program will see if it reads this
          particular XML file. Treatment of both whitespace and alternatives is obviously
          problematic.</p>
        <p>As regards whitespace, spaces cannot be placed between all elements, since this is often
          not desired, as in the cases of partially formatted or canceled words and individual
          letters or syllables. And in XML not all whitespaces are equal: some are for
          pretty-printing the XML itself and some are content (<ref type="bibl" target="#bray08"
            >Bray et al. 2008, Â§2.10</ref>), and a parser cannot tell which is which without
          reference to a schema. Furthermore, even if the parser uses a schema it will likely join
          up alternatives, because there is no significant whitespace between <gi>rdg</gi> elements
          in an <gi>app</gi>.</p>
        <p>As regards searching, the juxtaposition of alternatives in the same text stream will lead
          to invalid results. In lines 13â€“15 <q>that one subject is to starts</q>, <q>that oneâ€™s
            prone to starts of wrong</q> and <q>he shall sometimes prove insure</q> belong to
          different layers, but a search engine would treat them all as part of the same
          sentence.</p>
        <p>The solution to all this seems simple enough. One can just write a program that
          understands this particular encoding, and is able to tease apart the layers, or to take
          the first or last layer and discard the rest. This splitting into layers is an accepted
          technique, as used in Gablerâ€™s edition of <title level="m">Ulysses</title> (<ref
            type="bibl" target="#gabler84">Gabler, Steppe, and Melchior 1984, x</ref>), and also in
          HNML (<ref type="bibl" target="#zapf06">Zapf 2006</ref>). But how easy is it, exactly?</p>
        <p>Consider the sequences of variants in line 3 and in lines 16â€“19 in example 1. In line 3
          there are three successive alternatives, and in lines 16â€“19 there are four. Since the last
          alternative in line 3 is uncanceled it belongs by default to both the third and fourth
          layers of lines 16â€“19. It is <soCalled>by default</soCalled> because in autographs like
          this there is usually no way of telling which layer in line 3 was current when the
          unrelated changes were made to lines 16â€“19 (<ref type="bibl" target="#pierazzo09">Pierazzo
            2009, 185</ref>). By marking it up as a sequence of corrections, whether as <gi>rdg</gi>
          or via <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi>, there is already an implicit ordering of variants.
          The only difference is that here the alternatives are being assigned to default numbered
          layers; otherwise the information recorded is exactly the same. (A diplomatic rendition
          could still be produced from the layered representation.) So the main objective is to read
          coherent layers from the marked-up text, but for this to work, alternatives in one place
          must be coupled with sensible alternatives elsewhere. <ptr type="crossref"

        <p>Since the <gi>sic</gi>/<gi>corr</gi> is an editorial directive, rather than an authorial
          change, it effectively splits layer 1 into two sublayers. Writing a general program to
          extract such layers from any TEI file is hard because different encoders use different
          ways to record deletions and alternatives. For example, the encoders here opted to mark
          text inside <gi>rdg</gi> codes that disappeared in the next layer with <gi>del</gi>,
          treating it effectively as a crossing-out format. But the <gi>del</gi> codes outside of
          the <gi>app</gi>
          <emph>do</emph> create new layers: that is, they are not mere formats. Another encoder
          might find that too confusing, and regard all <gi>del</gi> codes as introducing a new
          layer, forcing the program to be adjusted. And what if <q>grimly</q> had been canceled
          instead of <q>sternly</q>? Then <q>sternly</q> would replace <q>grimly</q> in layer 4, but
          not in 3. And what about the bare <gi>add</gi> in line 3: the content of this element
          belongs to layers 2, 3, and 4 but not to 1.</p>
        <p>It is obvious from considerations like these that what seems on the surface to be a
          simple problem is actually very messy and difficult to handle. A program has to compute
          all this correctly, for as wide a range of texts as possible. In fact it took the author a
          week of continuous work to adapt an already existing splitter program to work with this
          material.</p>
        <p>These problems would all disappear if layers were stored separately. This would greatly
          simplify editing, since the user and the programmer would only have to deal with one layer
          at a time. The simple text editor described above in section 3 could be used, since all
          the complex markup would already be expressed through layers.</p>

        <p>As argued here, one way forward is to divide data into functional categories. A digital
          scholarly edition could be re-expressed as a bundle containing: <list rend="ordered">
            <item>plain text or HTML versions, one per internal layer, for each document that
              witnesses the work in question</item>
            <item>separate markup if plain text is used</item>

        <p>AustESE currently uses a zipped folder structure to represent all this information,
          including paratextual information such as biographies, in as application-independent a
          manner as possible. Alternative formats like HTML, TEXT, MVD, and XML are provided for the
          source documents, and the application that is reading it only has to choose one. Single or
          multiple editions can be stored in the one container, and these can be uploaded to or
          downloaded from digital scholarly editions on the Web using the <ref
            target="https://github.com/AustESE-Infrastructure/psef-tool"
                >psef-tool</ref>,<note><p><ptr
                target="https://github.com/AustESE-Infrastructure/psef-tool"/>.</p></note> to create
          a portable scholarly edition format. In future psef-archives may be expressed in standard
          formats such as <ref target="http://www.idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-overview.html"
            >EPUB</ref>.<note><p>EPUB3 Overview: Recommended Specification, October 11, 2011, <ptr
                target="http://www.idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-overview.html"/>.</p></note>
          However, EPUB3 doesnâ€™t currently support annotations, although they are likely to be added
          to the next version of EPUB.<note><p>EPUB3 Annotation. Epub-revision. <ptr

        <p>But the main advantage of this entire approach is that, however it is realized, the model
          is designed to support interoperability from the start. Scholars need a separate package
          of data that they can exchange and use in a variety of programs and platforms, a package
          they can identify with clearly as a <soCalled>digital scholarly edition</soCalled>,
          however it is rendered or edited in practice.</p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="conclusion">
        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>If there is one point to be drawn from this whole question of interoperability, it is
          that what is being advocated here is a divide-and-conquer approach, as opposed to the
          all-in-one design of the TEI document. This is not really mitigated by the common practice
          of pipelining, or building a TEI document from separate components. The schema still
          specifies that it is all-in-one, and markup and internal versions are still embedded
          within the text. This document-centric nature of TEI contrasts with the modern
          data-centric world, where the focus is much more on connecting relatively smaller chunks
          of data (<ref type="bibl" target="#berners-lee06">Berners-Lee 2006</ref>).</p>
        <p>Interoperability also is not a goal that can be ignored simply because it is judged to be
            <q>impossible</q> using current technology. What matters is what users need, and they
          need interoperability now more than ever. Human interpretations will never be
          interoperable on their own, but it is possible to incorporate them into a technological
          structure that takes into account their variability.</p>
        <p>The creation of customized SGML/XML encodings of literary and historical documents has
          not yet led to general sharing and collaboration in twenty-six years of trying, and the
          case has been made here that it never will. There is something fundamentally different
          about the way digital humanists encode texts that seems to make this impossible.</p>
        <p>The objective of AustESE is to create digital scholarly editions that are as far as
          possible interoperable, and general tools to manage and visualize them. There is still
          much work to be done, for example, in building the stand-off editor outlined here, and
          tools for linking text and images need to be completed. But ideally the digital scholarly
          edition should be an <emph>abstract</emph> specification or model that can be realized in
          a variety of technological ways, so that it may conform to the ever-present currents of
          change.</p>
