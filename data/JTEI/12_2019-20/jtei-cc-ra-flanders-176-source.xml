        <p>This paper focuses on recent work by the TEI Archiving, Preservation, and Access Service
          (TAPAS) on pedagogy with TEI, and specifically on a recent initiative called
            <soCalled>TAPAS Classroom</soCalled> focused on exploring pedagogical uses of TEI. We
          provide some background on TAPAS, describe several case studies involving pedagogical
          partners who used TAPAS in teaching, and finally describe the TAPAS Classroom initiative
          and its outcomes.</p>

        <p><ref target="http://www.tapasproject.org">TAPAS</ref><note><p><ptr
                target="http://www.tapasproject.org"/>.</p></note> originated with the needs of
          humanities scholars and specifically with the rise (in the first decade of the
          twenty-first century) of scholarly interest in text encoding as a core humanities method.
          With expertise supported by the proliferation of text encoding workshops aimed at
          humanists, such scholars were typically not affiliated with large established projects but
          were often working independently on small, monograph- or article-scale projects, such as
          an edition of a single text, a small collection of manuscripts, or a small run of a local
          periodical. As already noted in a previous article (<ref target="#flanders2013"
            type="bibl">Flanders and Hamlin 2013</ref>), infrastructure for TEI publication was at
          that time (and still remains to some extent) challenging for individual scholars and small
          projects, because of the costs and logistics of maintaining servers, developing and
          supporting XSLT stylesheets, and maintaining technical expertise for troubleshooting and
          longer term support. TAPAS was developed to provide an alternative in the form of a
          web-based service for publishing TEI data. It offers a growing infrastructure of TEI
          publishing tools, a publishing venue that highlights the value of using TEI, and a
          long-term guarantee of visibility and access to the TEI data. TAPAS was originally hosted
          at Brown University and is now hosted at Northeastern University, which also provides a
          guarantee of long-term repository support for TAPAS data. TAPAS has been generously funded
          by the TEI Consortium and by an initial planning grant from the Institute for Museum and
          Library Services, a digital humanities startup grant from the NEH, a research and
          development grant from the NEH, and most recently a digital humanities advancement grant
          which has supported TAPAS Classroom.</p>

        <head>TAPAS Classroom and TEI Pedagogy</head>
        <p>What do we envision when we think of TEI <soCalled>in the classroom</soCalled>? Three
          scenarios are particularly prominent. The first involves <emph>students contributing to
            TEI projects</emph>. Many faculty who lead TEI projects seek to involve students in
          those projects, either as part of a formal course or workshop, or through internships or
          paid positions. Here the term <soCalled>classroom</soCalled> may be quite literal, but it
          also may entail a broader range of pedagogical activities whereby students learn on the
          job. For the students, learning TEI may be an important and useful outcome (if they are
          interested in working on TEI projects or pursuing a TEI project of their own), but it may
          also be just one piece of a larger learning experience centering around the creation,
          management, and publication of digital materials. A second scenario involves
            <emph>students experimenting with TEI encoding</emph> in (digital) humanities courses or
          short workshops which aim to introduce them to the concepts of text markup. Here, TEI may
          be most valuable as an approachable form of data modeling that uses familiar concepts and
          terminology, and that usefully demonstrates the separation of data modeling from data
          presentation. In these situations, the goal is not to create high-quality TEI files or to
          give the students a thorough grounding in the TEI vocabulary but rather to stimulate
          thought and discussion using TEI as a stimulus. A third scenario involves <emph>students
            creating their own TEI projects</emph> in digital humanities courses or humanities
          courses, often as a substantial assignment in which the student selects, transcribes,
          encodes, and contextualizes one or more texts. Here, even though TEI skills may be only
          one part of a larger goal of acquainting students with digital humanities project planning
          and publishing tools, the sustained nature of the undertaking means that students will
          have an opportunity to gain familiarity with TEI, and that they may produce TEI data of
          enduring value. <ptr target="#table1" type="crossref"/> summarizes the potential learning
          outcomes in each of these scenarios. <table xml:id="table1">

          </table> During the development of TAPAS Classroom, several scholars were already
          experimenting with using TAPAS pedagogically. The following case studies describe how
          these different scenarios played out in practice.</p>
        <div xml:id="scenario1">
          <head>Scenario 1: A Course Designed Around Student Participation in a Faculty Research
            Project.</head>
          <p>Karen Bourrier, Digital Dinah Craik (<ptr target="http://www.tapasproject.org/node/443"
            />)</p>
          <p>Karen Bourrier is a faculty member at the University of Calgary and has been using
            TAPAS for her project, <title level="m">Digital Dinah Craik</title>; a presentation at
            TEI 2017 by her research assistant and project editor Kailey Fukushima described the
            project’s work in detail. This project includes close to four hundred TEI files
            organized into six distinct collections. The project team includes a rotating group of
            undergraduate and graduate students who typically have no TEI experience when they start
            work, and who transcribe, encode, and add enhanced markup to each text as it proceeds
            through the project’s workflow. They are trained to encode in TEI/XML (using the Oxygen
            XML editor) and to use TAPAS once a completed text is ready to publish. Professor
            Bourrier’s pedagogical objectives for the course include professionalization of students
            through involvement in long-term digital projects, and engaging students in
            collaborative relationships with faculty and scholars in their field. (Kailey Fukushima
            reported that TAPAS publication constituted a useful addition to students’ CVs.)
            Practically speaking, because of the students’ lack of prior experience with TEI, it was
            important to have easy-to-use tools so that students could focus on concepts and gain
            fluency, thereby streamlining the process of training students to work on the
            project.</p>
          <p>Professor Bourrier’s pedagogical experimentation with TAPAS yielded several specific
            design considerations. First, a close linkage between process and outcome is valuable in
            motivating students and focusing their effort, so a workflow that permits immediate
            publication (and in which the concept of <soCalled>publication</soCalled> and the
            criteria for readiness are in the control of the instructor) has pedagogical value.
            Second, to support work in collaborative teams the publishing platform has a role to
            play in reinforcing the students’ sense of working as a team, through actions like
            sharing and reviewing draft work, being able to track progress towards a final
            publication goal, and being able to communicate with other team members through comments
            and discussion.</p>

            schedule at <ptr target="http://tei.academic.wlu.edu/dh-190-w15/schedule/"/>)</p>
          <p>Mackenzie Brooks is an assistant professor and digital humanities librarian at
            Washington and Lee University, who used TAPAS in two iterations of a one-credit
              <soCalled>lab</soCalled> course on scholarly text encoding with TEI, accompanying a
            course in French literature taught by Professor Stephen P. McCormick. The course covered
            the origins and theoretical orientations of text markup, document analysis, schema
            creation, encoding, and publication, and also provided students with a grounding in the
            technical skills necessary to create a digital edition as part of the work they were
            doing in the accompanying literature class. Working in groups, students created simple
            digital editions focused on a specific text drawn from the university’s rare book and
            manuscript collection.</p>
          <p>As Brooks reported in a paper that described this course in detail (<ref
              target="#brooks2017" type="bibl">Brooks 2017</ref>), digital humanities at Washington
            and Lee University has a strongly pedagogical focus, and this course was an experimental
            contribution to a discussion of what a DH course or indeed an entire DH curriculum might
            look like. Framing the digital component as a one-credit <soCalled>lab</soCalled>
            course, taught by library faculty, offered a way to integrate digital approaches more
            flexibly into the curriculum without creating a burden for disciplinary faculty. In this
            context, a platform like TAPAS enables the instructors to focus on the challenges of
            teaching text encoding and to reduce the technical overhead for both students and
            instructors so that questions relating to editorial theory and practice and literary
            interpretation can come to the fore.</p>
          <p>Constance Crompton and Michelle Levy, Simon Fraser University (<title level="m">Lyrical
              Ballads</title>, <ptr target="https://lyricalballadssfu.wordpress.com/"/>).</p>
          <p>Connie Crompton is a faculty member at the University of Ottawa (at the time of the
            course, she was at UBC Okanagan). She worked with a course that was taught by Michelle
            Levy at Simon Fraser University and focused on creating a digital edition of
            Wordsworth’s and Coleridge’s <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>. In this case, all
            of the students collaborated on a single edition rather than working on their own. TAPAS
            was one of a range of tools the class experimented with, along with visualization tools
            like Tableau, publication tools like Islandora, and text analysis with R. Part of the
            design of the course was thus to experiment with the encoded TEI data through a
            plurality of tools and to produce a plurality of outcomes. This pedagogical orientation
            reinforces one of the core tenets (and challenges) of TAPAS’s design, which is to avoid
            creating orthodoxies in TEI encoding arising from display outcomes that appear
            authoritative. The diversification of view packages in TAPAS, and TAPAS’s role as one of
            many possible venues for publishing and displaying TEI data, can help encourage students
            of TEI to focus on the informational strength of their encoding rather than solely on
            the appearance of the output.</p>

            spring 2016 she taught a course on Digital Editing, in which her ten undergraduate
            students created individual digital TEI editions which were published in TAPAS as a
            private collection visible only to members of the project. The course was aimed at
            English majors with no encoding background, with a central learning goal of developing
            students’ skill in XML and TEI. It also attracted students from History and
            Communications. Here, as with Brooks’s course described above, having students create
            individual editions of their own design was an important focus and was closely aligned
            with the technical and conceptual skill of modeling textual data through text encoding.
            Treating the encoding process as a scholarly activity rather than a simple textual
            exercise aligns with core principles of digital humanities pedagogy articulated in
            articles such as <title level="a">A Tale of Two Internships: Developing Digital Skills
              Through Engaged Scholarship</title> (<ref target="#hswe2017" type="bibl">Hswe et al.
              2017</ref>), and also serves to empower students as both tool-users and creators of
            cultural meaning. Isbell noted that the ability to see their work realized as a readable
            edition was a crucial motivator for students in pushing through the process of learning
            and debugging their TEI/XML encoding. Because TAPAS was in beta when Isbell ran the
            course, she resourcefully integrated bug discovery and reporting explicitly into the
            course, so that students had some exposure to the processes of digital humanities tool
            development and had a sense of participation in that process—an unintended but very
            positive outcome.</p>

          <p>The <title level="m">Missionary Linguistics</title> project is part of an undergraduate
            thesis project undertaken by Doyle Calhoun with support from Anna Kijas, the Senior
            Digital Scholarship Librarian at Boston College. For this project, Calhoun encoded a
            proof-of-concept segment of a nineteenth-century dictionary, together with
            proof-of-concept authority lists for persons, organizations, and historical places.
            TAPAS served as the data repository for the encoded files, which were also published
            through a project web site that included an interactive map using CartoDB.<note><p>For a
                more detailed account of the project, see <ref target="#kijas2016" type="bibl">Kijas
                  (2016)</ref>.</p></note> In addition to the outcomes for Calhoun’s own degree
            program and professional development, Kijas had some larger pedagogical objectives from
            the perspective of her digital humanities center: to involve non-faculty (library and DH
            center staff) in student teaching and student research, at both undergraduate and
            graduate level, and to introduce and support TEI as part of an institution-level
            initiative.</p>
          <p>Although supporting student-led research was not on the TAPAS project’s radar as a very
            likely usage scenario during the initial planning and design process for TAPAS
            Classroom, it is an important outcome that underscores the potential benefits of having
            access to TAPAS at the institutional level (i.e., as a benefit of TEI institutional
            membership). From the perspective of the library, one important feature of the TAPAS
            service is that it provides a low-cost but durable infrastructure easy for novices to
            master. From the perspective of the student researcher, the important features are the
            longevity and stability of the data (enabling continuity of the project through
            successive institutional moves) as well as ease of use.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="goals">
        <head>Goals and Desiderata</head>
        <p>Based on these experiments, the TAPAS development team set several important design goals
          for the TAPAS Classroom project, in supporting pedagogy with TEI: <list>
            <item><emph>Make the process easier</emph>: For faculty who teach with TEI (either for
              its own sake or as part of a larger course in digital humanities or humanities), some
              supporting infrastructure is needed. TAPAS can ideally streamline or eliminate the
              process of getting access to shared server space, setting up student accounts, and
              ensuring that data is stored safely and can be accessed after the course is over.
              These functions are valuable for instructors at all levels of technical expertise but
              are particularly enabling for instructors familiar with TEI but not with its
              supporting technologies (XSLT, XML databases, web publishing frameworks).</item>
            <item><emph>Expose and demystify</emph>: The tool experimentation we saw in the <title
                level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> course and in Mary Isbell’s Digital Editing course
              suggested the value of a publication system that makes it possible to see the
              publication apparatus as such, and to look under the surface: for instance by offering
              different stylesheets and viewing options and showing that the formatted display of
              TEI is independent of the underlying encoding. TAPAS can offer a multiplicity of
              viewing options and an interface that makes it easy to move between them, enabling
              students to make direct comparisons between different ways of handling the data and
              offering a clear causal view in which changes to the data have a visible effect on the
              output (thereby motivating students to experiment with the markup in greater
              detail).</item>
            <item><emph>Support the encoding</emph>: In these scenarios, TAPAS was used as an
              end-point and a publication venue, but it is clear that there is pedagogical value in
              user-friendly TEI tools earlier in the classroom narrative as well. Mary Isbell, for
              instance, noted the potential value of student-level error messages, and Karen
              Bourrier observed how students learned from their encounter with the workflow
              management aspects of TAPAS. Through user-friendly validation, interactive ways to
              inspect the TEI encoding, and other ways for students to explore their encoding in
              progress from many perspectives, TAPAS has potential value as a source of approachable
              information that can inform the encoding process.</item>
          </list> Under TAPAS Classroom, several major new pieces of TAPAS were developed that
          respond to these desiderata. First, we developed new stylesheets for viewing TEI files,
          aimed specifically at pedagogical uses; this grant also gave us an opportunity to develop
          a fully modular system for managing these <soCalled>view packages</soCalled> (about which
          more below). Second, we re-examined the ways in which validation functions in TAPAS, and
          began developing tools that present validation to students in a specifically pedagogical
          context rather than as part of TAPAS’s own data management systems. Third, we developed a
          set of sample and template files to serve as starting points for students, recognizing
          that in short courses where the goal is to get students quickly oriented in a new skill
          (as for instance in the Crompton example described above), it could be helpful to have
          some pre-established starting points that are well contextualized and self-explanatory.
          And finally, we developed a <soCalled>community workshops</soCalled> space within TAPAS
          that simplifies the process of setting up a teaching environment, aimed particularly at
          instructors teaching shorter workshops that may be repeated over time. In what follows, we
          focus on two components in particular: the view packages and our initial forays into
          thinking about validation.</p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="viewPackages">
        <head>View Packages</head>
        <p>The display of TEI files through the TAPAS interface is handled—as with almost all modern
          web display of TEI data—through XSLT stylesheets, and indeed one of TAPAS’s most important
          functions is to enable users to transform and view their TEI data without having to write
          or run XSLT on their own. TAPAS’s XSLT stylesheets do not operate in isolation but as part
          of a more complex <soCalled>view package</soCalled> that includes several distinct
          components: <list>
            <item>One or more XSLT stylesheets which transform the source TEI data into another
              format (typically XHTML but potentially JSON or other formats that are particularly
              suited to some viewing application)</item>
            <item>A CSS stylesheet that provides styling information</item>
            <item>Optional JavaScript code to produce features of user interactivity (such as
              mouse-overs or selection of specific viewing options)</item>
            <item>Optional XProc code which handles the sequential processing of the data by the
              individual components of the view package</item>
            <item>Optional RELAX NG or ISO Schematron files that formalize any specific data
              constraints required by the view package (for instance, a view package for displaying
              a bibliography might include a test to ascertain that the file contains a
                <gi>listBibl</gi>)</item>
            <item>Metadata about the view package that supports its use within the TAPAS
              system</item>
            <item>Supporting documentation of the view package, including a manifest that describes
              its components and the expectations concerning the kinds of data for which it is best
              suited</item>
          </list> Typically, each view package is oriented around a specific usage scenario, user
          community, or type of data, and offers some options for user choices and configuration
          that are appropriate for that scenario. For instance, a view package might focus on the
          display of heavily revised manuscripts and might offer readers the ability to view
          successive revision stages or choose which revisers’ work to make visible. (This interface
          is not currently available in TAPAS but would be a great future project.) In this way,
          view packages serve as reading environments rather than as individual stylesheets, and
          they enable TAPAS to group together multiple viewing options that complement one another
          within a specific usage scenario, such as the ability to alternate between a normalized
          and a diplomatic view of a manuscript source. All view packages are maintained on GitHub,
          and a future goal for TAPAS is to use GitHub as a collaborative tool—enabling community
          members to propose and develop new view packages for inclusion in TAPAS.</p>
        <p>From the user perspective, TAPAS contributors can specify a default view package for a
          given record or collection, so that when a reader visits that material their initial view
          of the TEI data reflects the contributor’s choice. For instance, the creator of a
          collection of historic letters (such as the <title level="m"><ref
              target="https://digitalmitford.org/">Digital Mitford</ref></title> project) might
          choose a view package that handles manuscript features well, while the creator of a
          teaching collection aimed at sparking discussion of XML visualization might instead choose
          the Hieractivity view package (described below) as the default. However, whatever the
          default setting is, TAPAS readers can select any view package option in the reading
          interface (even if it goes against the grain of the data), and this may offer readers
          additional insight into the TEI data that is shared via TAPAS.</p>
        <div xml:id="generic">
          <head>TAPAS Generic View Package</head>
          <p>The basic goal of the TAPAS Generic view package is to handle almost any TEI markup in
            a moderately functional way. It is not intended as a high-function or specialized
            display; the term <soCalled>generic</soCalled> signals the fact that it displays TEI
            data in a general-purpose manner and can serve as the default stylesheet for almost any
            kind of data for which no more specialized viewing option has been provided. It offers a
            good basic reading interface, with a table of contents for navigation and the ability to
            shift between diplomatic and normalized views. For pedagogical purposes, it has the
            virtue that it is very forgiving: it does not require or assume adherence to any
            specific TEI schema or encoding protocol, and it produces a visible outcome from a wide
            variety of encoding features (so that any class involving TEI is likely to generate
            something that will get results). Its display options give emphasis to the areas of TEI
            encoding that see most frequent pedagogical use: personography and contextual
            information, transcription of primary source documents, and basic display of prose
            narratives such as fiction, life writing, and letters. It also supports renditional
            encoding (on <att>rend</att> or <att>style</att>) so that student encoders can exert
            some influence on the output. Instructors have also noted that it works well as a
            proofreading display to reveal both encoding errors and transcription errors.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="hieractivity">
          <head>Hieractivity View Package</head>
          <p>The Hieractivity view package was designed to offer a structural view rather than a
            textual view of a TEI document: that is, a view that emphasizes a reading of the markup
            rather than of the document itself. The view is zoomable so that a reader can view the
            document as if from a great distance to see its overall patterns, or up close to inspect
            particular features, and individual elements can be opened or collapsed. Similarly, the
            text can be <soCalled>zoomed</soCalled> from full visibility to invisibility. The
            package also works as a space for interactive inspection, offering the reader the
            ability to select specific elements for highlighting (from a list generated by the
            encoding in the document) and learn more about their frequency, distribution, and usage.
            Hieractivity is intended to stimulate students’ thinking about markup, focusing
            attention on how encoding reflects and enacts genre, and foregrounding the level of
            encoding detail and the presence of specific markup features. In a classroom setting,
            this view package can be used to compare the encoding of different texts and to
            highlight the differences and similarities between different students’ markup of the
            same text, between the structure of different texts, and between the encoding of
            different areas of the same text. The color highlighting and zoomability makes it easy
            to see patterns of comparison without having to interpret the TEI markup itself.
            Clicking on specific document structures produces a gloss on the markup being inspected,
            so that students can quickly see what markup was used in specific cases. This view can
            also serve as a report or rudimentary diagnostic of the markup in the text.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="other">
          <head>Other View Packages</head>
          <p>TAPAS currently also offers two other view packages: an XML view package which shows
            the XML code and a view that uses the open-source <ref
              target="http://dcl.ils.indiana.edu/teibp/index.html">TEI Boilerplate</ref>
                stylesheets.<note><p>TEI Boilerplate: <ptr
                  target="http://dcl.ils.indiana.edu/teibp/index.html"/>. See <ref
                  target="#walsh2013" type="bibl">Walsh and Simpson (2013)</ref>.</p></note> The XML
            view is not remarkable in itself, but it is pedagogically useful within the overall
            ecology of the view packages because it allows students to see the direct connection
            between the markup and the different outcomes in the other view packages. It is also
            helpful for troubleshooting and for comparing results with other students. The TEI
            Boilerplate view package was originally included because it offered an easy-to-install
            viewing option early in the TAPAS development process, but it has shown its value in
            other ways as well: it offers several proof-of-concept viewing options that help
            demonstrate the versatility of display through simple changes in CSS, and in the future
            it might offer a way for TAPAS to accommodate user-contributed CSS and control over
            document display by that means. It also connects TAPAS to other strands of research and
            development for TEI publication.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="validation">
        <head>Validation</head>
        <p>Validation was a key outcome for TAPAS Classroom and proved more challenging than we
          anticipated, for reasons that have to do with the way TAPAS data is ingested into the
          Fedora repository component and how it is handled once ingested. There are three basic
          functions validation can potentially play in TAPAS: <list>
            <item>To test files upon ingestion to ensure they are XML documents, and specifically,
              TEI; this is a gatekeeping function with a simple yes or no answer. TAPAS currently
              uses validation in this way.</item>
            <item>To provide users with a more detailed profile of their data once it gets into
              TAPAS. This function would go beyond the simple gatekeeping function to give users
              information about where their TEI data matches or fails to match a given schema. The
              first step in this detailed profiling would be to provide a more detailed validation
              report based on validation against the TAPAS schema (currently
              <ident>tei_all</ident>), but a further (and extremely valuable) step would be to
              support this with more detailed validation reporting against user-supplied schemas.
              TAPAS is currently developing a validation reporting feature, described in more detail
              below.</item>
            <item>To test a given file or set of files against a specific functional scenario. For
              instance, in the context of TAPAS view packages, validation could be used to discover
              and report on whether a given TEI file will work appropriately within a given view
              package, and if not, what is missing from the encoding.</item>
          </list> For pedagogical purposes, validation serves a very specific set of needs. First,
          it can give students information about their own encoding (for example in the context of
          an assignment prompt) and can reinforce what students are learning about TEI by providing
          immediate feedback on the semantics and usage of specific elements. It can also support an
          instructor in evaluating and providing feedback on student work, by highlighting encoding
          errors (and potentially inconsistencies as well, depending on the validation approach).
          And it can be a useful stimulus to an in-class discussion of encoding, through comparison
          of different encoding approaches in relation to the stipulations of the standard. In all
          of these cases, the validation process raises a pedagogically valuable set of questions
          about the relationship—involving epistemological power, authority, and social
          consensus—between a schema and the documents students create. In some pedagogical
          settings, the schema may be accorded the status of a standard to be achieved, while in
          others it may function in more complex and dialogic ways as a hypothesis about texts to be
          tested and revised.</p>
        <p>To support these pedagogical functions, TAPAS plans to treat validation in a somewhat
          novel way, using the view package technology to situate validation as a
            <soCalled>view</soCalled> of the document itself through the lens of a schema.
          Technically, the process involves: <list>
            <item>running a validation process in XProc</item>
            <item>running an XSLT stylesheet that integrates the validation output with the TEI
              document</item>
            <item>running an XSLT stylesheet that transforms the whole thing into HTML for display
              (with JavaScript as needed to support interaction such as navigation between the error
              report and the document itself).</item>
          </list> Along the way, the process substitutes error messages that are more intelligible
          to novices and also more reassuring and detailed, and collapses multiple occurrences of a
          given error message into a single instance. The result is to position the validation view
          less as an authoritative and fearsome report of failure and more as an informational
          report that describes the relationship between the document and the schema that has been
          invoked. An initial version of the validation view package was developed for TAPAS
          Classroom and is scheduled for release in 2020.</p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="conclusion">
        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>Pedagogical uses of TEI pose varied and distinctive requirements which depend on the role
          TEI plays in a particular classroom setting. In some cases, the goal may be to learn TEI
          and to excite students about its potential as a digital humanities tool. In other cases,
          the goal may be to use TEI as a way of framing a conversation about digital editing, data
          modeling, or data visualization. TAPAS (and the features developed through the TAPAS
          Classroom project) offers a platform for TEI display and publication that allows the
          complexities of TEI encoding to take a back seat—through encoding templates and a simple
          upload and publication workflow—in cases where expertise in TEI is not the main goal of
          the class. But at the same time, it offers the ability to look beneath the surface of
          those systems at any time, to gain greater insight into the encoding, and to explore what
          happens if the code or the display choices are changed. TAPAS also supports varied roles
          for students that give them different forms of scaffolded authority: as contributors to
          real-world publications, as creators of their own projects, as collaborators and
          experimenters in public spaces. TAPAS thus supports a vision of digital humanities
          pedagogy that is experiential, experimental, and collaborative.</p>
