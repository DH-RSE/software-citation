# Software citation in the Digital Humanities

This project contains data and evaluation of citation of software in the Digital Humanities.


## Data

We provide the following datasets in the directory data/ (in TEI/XML format):

* Papers from DH conferences, years 2015â€“2020, originally published on ADHO's GitHub page: https://github.com/ADHO/ (licenced under CC BY). They were however retrieved in TEI format from the ToolXtractor's GitHub page: https://github.com/lehkost/ToolXtractor (licenced under Apache 2.0). Quote from ToolXtractor's Readme: "for papers of DH2017 we used the tool Grobid to create XML-TEI files (however, Grobid failed to convert all files properly, some of these conversions contain only parts of the PDF versions" (https://github.com/lehkost/ToolXtractor#datasets).
